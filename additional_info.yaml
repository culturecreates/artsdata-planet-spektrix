# To add a new source, copy the structure below and replace the key ("albertatheatreprojects") 
# with the source identifier (usually the organization's slug or name). 
# Each source can define its own attributes, such as:
#   - attribute_EventUrl: the URL where events are listed
#   - offerUrl: a booking/purchase URL that may include placeholders (e.g., {webInstanceId})
# Add additional attributes as needed for that source.
#
# Example structure:
#
# sourcename1:
#   attribute_EventUrl: "https://example.com/events1"
#   offerUrl: "https://example.com/book/?id={eventId1}"
#
# sourcename2:
#   attribute_EventUrl: "https://example.com/events2"
#   offerUrl: "https://example.com/tickets/?event={eventId2}"
