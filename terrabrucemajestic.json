    "description": "Valmy is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Ontario who‚Äôs been following the ocean and making home on the East Coast. Exploring themes of wonder, loss, and healing, she uses her folk-influenced music to tell stories about loving and stumbling your way through the dark. Based in St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland, Valmy creates and performs by weaving nature-inspired melodic swells and atmospheric harmonies with her contemplative writing. Her debut full-length album ‚ÄòThe In Between‚Äô was independently released in September 2023 and warmly received listeners, with a thoughtful review from Tony Ploughman of Fred‚Äôs Records: ‚ÄúThe rhythms and melodies wrap around the mind and soul like a lovingly patched quilt‚Ä¶ There is a cohesiveness to this full album offering meditative musings on balancing ones own mental state in harmony with nature, the songs providing a methodical process to achieve that balance. And the underlying intensity to follow through on the beckoning of one‚Äôs thoughts and emotions to create is constant‚Ä¶Deftly produced, engineered and mixed, ‚ÄúThe In Between‚Äù is one of 2023‚Äôs finest NL Releases‚Äù. Valmy concluded 2023 with two MusicNL nominations, was a 2024 East Coast Music Award nominee, and was also nominated for three 2024 MusicNL awards for Alternative Artist, Solo Artist, and Ron Hynes Songwriter of the Year. She is looking forward to sharing selections from her album and new original songs during this solo performance at Theatre Hill, before connecting with audiences on her Autumn Tour through Eastern Canada.",
