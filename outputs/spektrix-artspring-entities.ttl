Horror, romance, humour, and science fiction are galvanized into a love story ballet inspired in equal parts by the classic creature, Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride, and the Romantic era ballet Giselle - an alchemy only director Paul Destrooper dares bring to the stage. <span><br/></span>     Founded in 2002, Ballet Victoria is a boutique professional ballet company with 12 dancers and four yearly productions. Having produced close to 100 new works, including 10 full length ballets, and toured in Canada, the USA and Mexico, Ballet Victoria’s artistic team is constantly exploring new territory. Performances are dramatic, technically demanding, and often laced with humour. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Thank you to Joan Farlinger and Salt Spring Coffee for sponsoring this performance.

	Witness a reimagining of Canadian history through Indigenous voices, music, and language. Les Filles du Roi is a ground-breaking musical by acclaimed writer, composer, and director Corey Payette, in collaboration with co-creator Julie McIsaac. Told in English, French, and Kanien’kéha (Mohawk), the story follows Kateri and Jean-Baptiste, two Mohawk siblings whose lives intersect with a young French immigrant, Marie-Jeanne, in 1665 “New France.” What begins as a colonial encounter unfolds into a rich narrative of resilience, kinship, and transformation—blending cultures, challenging assumptions, and reshaping the story of who we are.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Night one features the stunning feature film adaptation of the musical, directed by Payette, and celebrated at TIFF and festivals worldwide. This cinematic version brings the theatrical work to life in breathtaking visual and musical detail.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Night two is an extraordinary live concert experience featuring selections from the original score performed by guest artists and musicians. With soaring vocals, layered harmonies, and traditional instrumentation, the music draws from Indigenous and European musical traditions while defying genre altogether.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This is more than performance—it’s a cultural reckoning, a reclamation, and an invitation to reimagine the founding myths of this country. Moving, unforgettable, and artistically daring, Les Filles du Roi is a rare experience that speaks to the heart of truth, reconciliation, and the power of song.<span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	Formed in 2016, Duo Cordelia features violinist and composer Vanessa Marcoux and pianist Marie-Christine Poirier who seek to challenge audiences’ experiences and expectations of chamber music. A noted ensemble active on the Canadian classical music scene, Duo Cordelia’s mission is to expand the possibilities of a classical concert by introducing improvisation, an array of exciting repertoire from the 20th and 21st century, and arrangements of traditional melodies with original compositions. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This rich combination of classical repertoire and lesser-known works allows the listener to draw new bridges between musical universes that would otherwise be dissociated. From Shostakovich to Philip Glass, the result is a touching and unique concert experience which goes straight to the heart of our deep connection with music.

  schema:description """
	Sat May 30, 10am | On May 30, the Metropolitan Opera’s 2025–26 Live in HD season comes to a close with a live transmission of American composer Gabriela Lena Frank’s first opera, a magical-realist portrait of Mexico’s painterly power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, with libretto by Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Nilo Cruz. Fashioned as a reversal of the Orpheus and Euridice myth, the story depicts Frida, sung by leading mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard, leaving the underworld on the Day of the Dead and reuniting with Diego, portrayed by baritone Carlos Álvarez. The famously feuding pair briefly relive their tumultuous love, embracing both the passion and the pain before bidding the land of the living a final farewell. Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts the Met-premiere staging of Frank’s opera, a “confident, richly imagined score” (The New Yorker) that “bursts with color and fresh individuality” (Los Angeles Times). The vibrant new production, taking enthusiastic inspiration from Frida and Diego’s paintings, is directed and choreographed by Deborah Colker. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>2 hr 50 mins | 1 intermission | Sung in Spanish | NEW PRODUCTION

	<h2>A Landmark Performance. A Once-in-a-Generation Voice.</h2><span><br/></span>Jeremy Dutcher is more than a musician—he’s a cultural guardian, a visionary, and one of the most compelling artistic voices in Canada today. A Two-Spirit song carrier and classically trained tenor from the Neqotkuk (Tobique First Nation) in Eastern Canada, Dutcher bridges the traditional and the contemporary in electrifying ways. His debut album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa unearthed archival recordings of his ancestors and transformed them into sweeping, genre-defying compositions—sung entirely in Wolastoqey, his endangered Indigenous language.<span><br/></span>It won the Polaris Music Prize in 2018. He did it again in 2024 with Motewolonuwok—becoming the first artist in history to win twice.<span><br/></span>Dutcher’s live performances are theatrical, deeply emotional, and rich with musical storytelling. With a sound that moves between grand piano, operatic tenor, jazz, and traditional Wolastoqey song, his concerts are both reverent and radical—described by NPR as “music like no other,” and by CBC as “moment-defining.”<span><br/></span>Beyond the stage, Dutcher is a public thinker and activist on Indigeneity, queerness, and language revitalization. He has collaborated with artists like Yo-Yo Ma and Feist, and been profiled in Vogue, Rolling Stone, and The Globe and Mail.<span><br/></span>At ArtSpring, this is more than a concert. It’s an encounter with living history, contemporary brilliance, and the transformative power of art.<span><br/></span>

We dance as an offering of allyship to the stewards of these territories. We dance for the repair and reclamation of our own ancestral wounds and gifts. We dance as a ceremony of reconciliation with what has been. We hold a prayer for wholeness, integrity and peace and a commitment to show up more fully for this land that we live on. We hold this prayer as a rite of passage into deeper leadership within our communities.

  schema:description """
	Witness a reimagining of Canadian history through Indigenous voices, music, and language. Les Filles du Roi is a ground-breaking musical by acclaimed writer, composer, and director Corey Payette, in collaboration with co-creator Julie McIsaac. Told in English, French, and Kanien’kéha (Mohawk), the story follows Kateri and Jean-Baptiste, two Mohawk siblings whose lives intersect with a young French immigrant, Marie-Jeanne, in 1665 “New France.” What begins as a colonial encounter unfolds into a rich narrative of resilience, kinship, and transformation—blending cultures, challenging assumptions, and reshaping the story of who we are.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Night one features the stunning feature film adaptation of the musical, directed by Payette, and celebrated at TIFF and festivals worldwide. This cinematic version brings the theatrical work to life in breathtaking visual and musical detail.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Night two is an extraordinary live concert experience featuring selections from the original score performed by guest artists and musicians. With soaring vocals, layered harmonies, and traditional instrumentation, the music draws from Indigenous and European musical traditions while defying genre altogether.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This is more than performance—it’s a cultural reckoning, a reclamation, and an invitation to reimagine the founding myths of this country. Moving, unforgettable, and artistically daring, Les Filles du Roi is a rare experience that speaks to the heart of truth, reconciliation, and the power of song.<span><br/></span>

	Salt Spring Baroque is excited to present, from Nova Scotia, Ménestrel, in THE ORDER OF GOOD CHEER. Ménestrel is an alternative early music group co-founded by Janelle Lucyk (soprano and violin) and Kerry Bursey (tenor and lutes). The Order of Good Cheer, founded by Samuel de Champlain in 1606, was America’s first social club where wine, camaraderie, theater and music came together to brighten cold winters. The program features songs inspired by the sea, the new world, absence and hope, timeless melodies and songs that have forged the bonds of French-Canadian culture and music today. Ménestrel creates a reimagining of these evenings together, with music from the 17th Century that remains ever so timeless today.

	<span class=\"ItalicText\">Bach’s Goldberg Variations</span>—a masterpiece of invention, intricacy, and emotion—takes on new life in this bold reimagining by director and keyboardist Alexander Weimann. Performed by the acclaimed Pacific Baroque Orchestra, this chamber arrangement transforms a solo keyboard icon into a radiant ensemble experience, breathing fresh colour into Bach’s timeless score. Weimann’s orchestration draws inspiration not only from Bach’s original writing but also from the music of Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, weaving new textures for strings, winds, and harpsichord. Composed during a time of personal hardship, these variations reveal a world of grief, wit, and resilience. For seasoned listeners and newcomers alike, this performance offers a rare opportunity to hear a baroque monument from a vivid new perspective.

Narrated in Ayajuthem and English by Elder Elsie Paul, it’s a landmark piece by a fully Indigenous creative team. Paired with Carmina Burana—a visually striking, high-energy ballet choreographed by Mauricio Wainrot to Carl Orff’s epic cantata—this program contrasts ancient legend with explosive modernity. Featuring a select ensemble of 12 dancers, this performance delivers a rare chance to witness the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s artistry in an intimate setting.<span><br/></span>

	Met Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin takes the podium on May 17 to conduct Strauss’s one-act tragedy, which will be transmitted live from the Metropolitan Opera stage to cinemas worldwide. Leading the company’s first new production of the work in 20 years, Claus Guth, one of Europe’s leading opera directors, gives the biblical story a psychologically perceptive Victorian-era setting. South African soprano Elza van den Heever leads a celebrated cast as the abused and unhinged antiheroine, with Swedish baritone Peter Mattei as the imprisoned prophet Jochanaan; German tenor Gerhard Siegel as Salome’s lecherous stepfather, King Herod; American mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung as his wife, Herodias; and Polish tenor Piotr Buszewski as Narraboth.

	Salt Spring Baroque is excited to present storyteller, CBC radio host and musician Tom Allen in a show about the life of a young Johann Sebastian Bach. This blend of music, storytelling, and historical research illuminates a little-known period of the composer’s life.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>At 20, in his first job and still barely beginning life as a composer, the young JS Bach got into such trouble that the only thing he could do was to walk away. JS Bach’s Long Walk in the Snow takes you along on that trip: a 400 km odyssey to a glittering northern port city with street fights, big business, the father figure he didn’t know he needed and, quite possibly, love. With glorious music from harpist Lori Gemmell, violist Dave Harding, spectacular singer Suzie LeBlanc and storyteller/trombonist Tom Allen, JS Bach’s Long Walk in the Snow brings that troubled young man in from the cold.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>https://saltspringbaroque.com/

	Salt Spring Baroque presents an uplifting program of baroque works to celebrate the joy of springtime, given by a trio of top baroque specialists, Christi Meyers (violin), Chloe Meyers (violin), and Alexander Weimann (harpsichord). The program will feature the trio sonata form, which originated in the 17th century and was a favourite chamber ensemble combination throughout the baroque era and is still used today by modern composers. The genre originated as instrumental adaptation of the three-part texture common in Italian vocal music in the late 16th century. The concert will include works by Bach, Handel, Leclair, Goldberg and Archangelo Corelli, one of the most influential composers of the trio sonata.

	Trailblazing jazz singer Judi Singh defied expectations as a Canadian artist of mixed Black & Punjabi heritage in the 1950s and ‘60s, playing to sold-out crowds in Edmonton. Though her ethereal, pitch-perfect voice captivated adoring audiences, the music industry failed to support her career – an all-too-familiar story for women and artists of colour – although her 1970 album “A Time for Love” with Tommy Banks is still highly prized. In this lively and deeply-felt portrait, award-winning filmmaker Baljit Sangra retraces Singh’s life through the places she lived – including Winnipeg, Toronto and Victoria, where Singh died in 2021 – and the intimate recollections of the family & friends who loved her, including world-renowned Indigenous actor Tantoo Cardinal. Weaving together moments of brilliance and resilience, this crowd-pleasing film reintroduces a gifted artist to the spotlight she so richly deserves. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Co-presented by Salt Spring Music Events and the Salt Spring Jazz & Blues Society.

  schema:description """
	In this poignant and poetic dance-theatre work by Hiromoto Ida (Shōgun, The Man in the High Castle) a long-married couple revisits the now-empty lot where their family home once stood. What begins as a tender sharing of memories gradually opens into a meditation on time, impermanence, and the fragility of life itself. Inspired by Shogo Ota’s play SARACHI, Vacant Lot blends movement, dialogue, and stillness to explore both the ache and absurdity of human existence. Dancers Lindsay Clague and Ida move through joy, loss, and humour with exquisite nuance, embodying our collective longing for connection. At once intimate and expansive, this work teeters between the everyday and the eternal—where each moment is both fleeting and infinite.

	Special Treasure Fair Fundraiser Concert<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Victoria Times-Colonist called Zachary a “dead ringer for dead singers” for his uncanny ability to replicate the sound and personalities of legendary musicians on stage. In this intimate revue, Zachary shares his unusual musical journey portraying the likes of Hank Williams, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Phil Ochs and Buddy Holly. A “Jeff” (Chicago Theatre) Award winner for his outstanding performance in BUDDY: The Buddy Holly Story, Time Out Chicago says “it’s frankly hard to imagine a better Buddy; Stevenson’s all-in performance will stick with you and not fade away.” Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune exclaimed “If you don’t like him, you don’t like much of anybody.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>With intimate stories and iconic songs, Dead Ringer is a charming glimpse inside the actor’s life and the artists he inhabits. With vivid characterizations and meticulous musical authenticity, this charming tribute is proof that legends never truly die.
