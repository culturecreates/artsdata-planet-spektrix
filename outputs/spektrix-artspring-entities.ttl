  schema:description """
	     Experience Mary Shelley’s original gothic tale with an imaginative twist as Ballet Victoria sets original choreography to a blend of classical and contemporary music to present Frankenstein as never before seen. Horror, romance, humour, and science fiction are galvanized into a love story ballet inspired in equal parts by the classic creature, Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride, and the Romantic era ballet Giselle - an alchemy only director Paul Destrooper dares bring to the stage. <span><br/></span>     Founded in 2002, Ballet Victoria is a boutique professional ballet company with 12 dancers and four yearly productions. Having produced close to 100 new works, including 10 full length ballets, and toured in Canada, the USA and Mexico, Ballet Victoria’s artistic team is constantly exploring new territory. Performances are dramatic, technically demanding, and often laced with humour. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Thank you to Joan Farlinger and Salt Spring Coffee for sponsoring this performance.

With soaring vocals, layered harmonies, and traditional instrumentation, the music draws from Indigenous and European musical traditions while defying genre altogether.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This is more than performance—it’s a cultural reckoning, a reclamation, and an invitation to reimagine the founding myths of this country. Moving, unforgettable, and artistically daring, Les Filles du Roi is a rare experience that speaks to the heart of truth, reconciliation, and the power of song.<span><br/></span>

	Formed in 2016, Duo Cordelia features violinist and composer Vanessa Marcoux and pianist Marie-Christine Poirier who seek to challenge audiences’ experiences and expectations of chamber music. A noted ensemble active on the Canadian classical music scene, Duo Cordelia’s mission is to expand the possibilities of a classical concert by introducing improvisation, an array of exciting repertoire from the 20th and 21st century, and arrangements of traditional melodies with original compositions. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This rich combination of classical repertoire and lesser-known works allows the listener to draw new bridges between musical universes that would otherwise be dissociated.

  schema:description """
	Sat May 30, 10am | On May 30, the Metropolitan Opera’s 2025–26 Live in HD season comes to a close with a live transmission of American composer Gabriela Lena Frank’s first opera, a magical-realist portrait of Mexico’s painterly power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, with libretto by Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Nilo Cruz. Fashioned as a reversal of the Orpheus and Euridice myth, the story depicts Frida, sung by leading mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard, leaving the underworld on the Day of the Dead and reuniting with Diego, portrayed by baritone Carlos Álvarez. The famously feuding pair briefly relive their tumultuous love, embracing both the passion and the pain before bidding the land of the living a final farewell. Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts the Met-premiere staging of Frank’s opera, a “confident, richly imagined score” (The New Yorker) that “bursts with color and fresh individuality” (Los Angeles Times). The vibrant new production, taking enthusiastic inspiration from Frida and Diego’s paintings, is directed and choreographed by Deborah Colker. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>2 hr 50 mins | 1 intermission | Sung in Spanish | NEW PRODUCTION

	<h2>A Landmark Performance. A Once-in-a-Generation Voice.</h2><span><br/></span>Jeremy Dutcher is more than a musician—he’s a cultural guardian, a visionary, and one of the most compelling artistic voices in Canada today. A Two-Spirit song carrier and classically trained tenor from the Neqotkuk (Tobique First Nation) in Eastern Canada, Dutcher bridges the traditional and the contemporary in electrifying ways. His debut album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa unearthed archival recordings of his ancestors and transformed them into sweeping, genre-defying compositions—sung entirely in Wolastoqey, his endangered Indigenous language.<span><br/></span>It won the Polaris Music Prize in 2018. He did it again in 2024 with Motewolonuwok—becoming the first artist in history to win twice.<span><br/></span>Dutcher’s live performances are theatrical, deeply emotional, and rich with musical storytelling. With a sound that moves between grand piano, operatic tenor, jazz, and traditional Wolastoqey song, his concerts are both reverent and radical—described by NPR as “music like no other,” and by CBC as “moment-defining.”<span><br/></span>Beyond the stage, Dutcher is a public thinker and activist on Indigeneity, queerness, and language revitalization. He has collaborated with artists like Yo-Yo Ma and Feist, and been profiled in Vogue, Rolling Stone, and The Globe and Mail.<span><br/></span>At ArtSpring, this is more than a concert. It’s an encounter with living history, contemporary brilliance, and the transformative power of art.<span><br/></span>

	Monster Theatre’s Juliet, A Revenge Comedy asks the question - what if Shakespeare’s Juliet didn’t die? In this popular and award-winning show, we find Juliet stuck in an endless loop of turning a dagger on herself. But what if Juliet breaks out of her tragedy in search of a reason for her tragic demise? On the way, she recruits a team of Shakespeare’s most famous female characters to find out why they’ve been forced to die. Can they alter their fate or are they doomed to play out the same tragic tales for the rest of eternity? <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Carly Pokoradi reprises her Jesse award-winning role playing over 20 characters including Lady Macbeth and Ophelia to bring this canon-bending comedy to life once more. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Thank you to Debbi and Mark Toole for sponsoring this performance.

Tenor Xabier Anduaga co-stars as Amina’s fiancé, Elvino, alongside soprano Sydney Mancasola as her rival, Lisa, and bass Alexander Vinogradov as Count Rodolfo.

	Witness a reimagining of Canadian history through Indigenous voices, music, and language. Les Filles du Roi is a ground-breaking musical by acclaimed writer, composer, and director Corey Payette, in collaboration with co-creator Julie McIsaac. Told in English, French, and Kanien’kéha (Mohawk), the story follows Kateri and Jean-Baptiste, two Mohawk siblings whose lives intersect with a young French immigrant, Marie-Jeanne, in 1665 “New France.” What begins as a colonial encounter unfolds into a rich narrative of resilience, kinship, and transformation—blending cultures, challenging assumptions, and reshaping the story of who we are.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Night one features the stunning feature film adaptation of the musical, directed by Payette, and celebrated at TIFF and festivals worldwide. This cinematic version brings the theatrical work to life in breathtaking visual and musical detail.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Night two is an extraordinary live concert experience featuring selections from the original score performed by guest artists and musicians. With soaring vocals, layered harmonies, and traditional instrumentation, the music draws from Indigenous and European musical traditions while defying genre altogether.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This is more than performance—it’s a cultural reckoning, a reclamation, and an invitation to reimagine the founding myths of this country.

	Salt Spring Baroque is excited to present, from Nova Scotia, Ménestrel, in THE ORDER OF GOOD CHEER. Ménestrel is an alternative early music group co-founded by Janelle Lucyk (soprano and violin) and Kerry Bursey (tenor and lutes). The Order of Good Cheer, founded by Samuel de Champlain in 1606, was America’s first social club where wine, camaraderie, theater and music came together to brighten cold winters. The program features songs inspired by the sea, the new world, absence and hope, timeless melodies and songs that have forged the bonds of French-Canadian culture and music today. Ménestrel creates a reimagining of these evenings together, with music from the 17th Century that remains ever so timeless today.

  schema:description """
	<span class=\"ItalicText\">Bach’s Goldberg Variations</span>—a masterpiece of invention, intricacy, and emotion—takes on new life in this bold reimagining by director and keyboardist Alexander Weimann. Performed by the acclaimed Pacific Baroque Orchestra, this chamber arrangement transforms a solo keyboard icon into a radiant ensemble experience, breathing fresh colour into Bach’s timeless score. Weimann’s orchestration draws inspiration not only from Bach’s original writing but also from the music of Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, weaving new textures for strings, winds, and harpsichord. Composed during a time of personal hardship, these variations reveal a world of grief, wit, and resilience. For seasoned listeners and newcomers alike, this performance offers a rare opportunity to hear a baroque monument from a vivid new perspective.

	Lifelong friends, colleagues, and multi-talented musicians Nico Rhodes and Patrick Courtin were shocked and appalled by their realization that piano just isn’t cool anymore. This set off a quest to redeem the keyboard and reinstate its reputation as the greatest instrument of ALL TIME! <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Armed with the music of the greatest composers, songwriters, and performers of the past 300 years, and the technology of the 21st century - Nico and Patrick deliver everything from classical piano raptures and bombastic boogie woogie to romantic piano ballads and 80’s keyboard synth as they battle it out in their show Piano Heist! What ensues is a mishmash of theatrical wonder, comedy, audience participation, heartfelt stories, a pinch of history, and a world of musical madness.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Thank you to Kate Merry for sponsoring this performance.

  schema:description """
	Sat Jan 10, 10am | For gorgeous melody, spellbinding coloratura, and virtuoso vocal fireworks, I Puritani has few equals. On January 10, the first new Met production of Bellini’s final masterpiece in nearly 50 years—a striking staging by Charles Edwards, who makes his company directorial debut after many successes as a set designer—arrives in cinemas worldwide. The Met has assembled a world-beating quartet of stars, conducted by Marco Armiliato, for the demanding principal roles. Soprano Lisette Oropesa and tenor Lawrence Brownlee are Elvira and Arturo, brought together by love and torn apart by the political rifts of the English Civil War, with baritone Artur Ruciński as Riccardo, betrothed to Elvira against her will, and bass-baritone Christian Van Horn as Elvira’s sympathetic uncle, Giorgio. This live cinema transmission is part of the Met’s award-winning Live in HD series, bringing opera to movie theaters across the globe. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>3hr 45 mins | with 1 intermission | Sung in Italian | NEW PRODUCTION

Narrated in Ayajuthem and English by Elder Elsie Paul, it’s a landmark piece by a fully Indigenous creative team. Paired with Carmina Burana—a visually striking, high-energy ballet choreographed by Mauricio Wainrot to Carl Orff’s epic cantata—this program contrasts ancient legend with explosive modernity. Featuring a select ensemble of 12 dancers, this performance delivers a rare chance to witness the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s artistry in an intimate setting.<span><br/></span>

	Met Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin takes the podium on May 17 to conduct Strauss’s one-act tragedy, which will be transmitted live from the Metropolitan Opera stage to cinemas worldwide. Leading the company’s first new production of the work in 20 years, Claus Guth, one of Europe’s leading opera directors, gives the biblical story a psychologically perceptive Victorian-era setting. South African soprano Elza van den Heever leads a celebrated cast as the abused and unhinged antiheroine, with Swedish baritone Peter Mattei as the imprisoned prophet Jochanaan; German tenor Gerhard Siegel as Salome’s lecherous stepfather, King Herod; American mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung as his wife, Herodias; and Polish tenor Piotr Buszewski as Narraboth.

Nat and Lamiae built an international quintet bringing in all-star musicians from Iran, the US and Spain, who infuse the sound with textured instrumentation and inspired improvisation. Sweeping kamancheh (Persian spike-fiddle) ornamentation plays off gritty bass grooves and explosive flamenco footwork, with Lamiae's fluidly riveting voice at the center, sending up sheets of cascading Andalusian melodies punctuated by the catchy hooks of North African Chaabi. The multicultural band is joined by the acclaimed fiery flamenco dancer and percussionist Manuel Gutierrez from Spain.

	In the rise of Spoken Word’s popularity, the genre cannot be discussed without saying the name Shane Koyczan. In 2010, the world caught a glimpse of Koyczan’s prodigious talent with his presentation at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. His stand-out performance helped shine a light on this street poet from Vancouver’s downtown east side. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This prolific artist has seen his books and videos used worldwide in classrooms and adapted by Vancouver Opera. His voice has been sought by luminaries like George Miller of Mad Max: Fury Road fame and David Suzuki as part of the environmental Blue Dot Tour. Shane’s fiercely honest TED Talk highlighted the kind of humanity he brings to each performance - tackling trauma, vulnerability, bravery, and even laughter in a way that viscerally connects with audiences.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Thank you to Paula Palyga and David Demers for sponsoring this performance.

Though her ethereal, pitch-perfect voice captivated adoring audiences, the music industry failed to support her career – an all-too-familiar story for women and artists of colour – although her 1970 album “A Time for Love” with Tommy Banks is still highly prized. In this lively and deeply-felt portrait, award-winning filmmaker Baljit Sangra retraces Singh’s life through the places she lived – including Winnipeg, Toronto and Victoria, where Singh died in 2021 – and the intimate recollections of the family & friends who loved her, including world-renowned Indigenous actor Tantoo Cardinal. Weaving together moments of brilliance and resilience, this crowd-pleasing film reintroduces a gifted artist to the spotlight she so richly deserves. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Co-presented by Salt Spring Music Events and the Salt Spring Jazz & Blues Society.

  schema:name "VACANT LOT (AP)";
  schema:description """
	In this poignant and poetic dance-theatre work by Hiromoto Ida (Shōgun, The Man in the High Castle) a long-married couple revisits the now-empty lot where their family home once stood. What begins as a tender sharing of memories gradually opens into a meditation on time, impermanence, and the fragility of life itself. Inspired by Shogo Ota’s play SARACHI, Vacant Lot blends movement, dialogue, and stillness to explore both the ache and absurdity of human existence. Dancers Lindsay Clague and Ida move through joy, loss, and humour with exquisite nuance, embodying our collective longing for connection. At once intimate and expansive, this work teeters between the everyday and the eternal—where each moment is both fleeting and infinite.
