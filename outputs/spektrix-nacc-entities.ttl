  schema:name "Alteration";
  schema:description """
	How do we manage to prosperous balances? What happens when they break down? Alteration addresses the transformations that punctuate our lives and our abilities to influence our own destiny and that of others. Aly Keita depicts an oscillating humanity on an intimate and societal level, between stability and uncertainty, anchoring and uprooting, change and resistance, renewal and repetition. The relationship with the other and the complexity of ties lead to the need to hear and rebuild our relationship with ourselves and with our environment. Exploring the meaning of relationships in our society in a wide-ranging way, both interpersonal relationships and those with other-than-human beings, this work opens the way to the construction of possible new links that are formed through ecological and spiritual dimensions. Here, life takes the form of a cycle of transformations. Memories of past experiences and scars – in other words, alteration – are transmuted into a vital breath through reactivating movements, both individual and collective, that revitalize our bodies and rekindle our inner power.

	<span class=\"BoldText\">A Co-Production with Longshadow Music Society</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Possessing “one of the purest sounds on the six string” (The Listening Sessions), guitarist-composer Brett Hansen has boldly stepped out from his work as one of Canada’s first-call session musicians with a striking debut album of his own, Confluence. Hansen’s compositions showcase his fleet technical skill and cinematic sonic palate, but perhaps most notable is his emotional and dynamic capacity to tell stories without words. Influences from his work in folk, rock, jazz, and orchestral ensembles shine across the album, which has remained on the international jazz charts since its release in 2024 and has garnered critical acclaim, drawing comparison to Pat Metheny and John Abercrombie. Brett Hansen has studied with the likes of Mike Stern, Julian Lage, Oz Noy, Matthew Stevens, Nir Felder, Jim Head, and Rez Abassi. He performs regularly as a part of the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, has toured internationally through Asia, Europe, and Canada, and has performed on hundreds of recordings across genres with some of Canada’s finest musicians across many genres of music. Without a doubt, Brett Hansen a guitarist “deserving of your attention” (The Intelligencer).

	When Matt Andersen steps on stage, he brings a lifetime of music to every note he plays. His latest album, The Hammer & The Rose, is a veritable garden of heart; a (mostly) delicate collection of tender folk and stirring soul numbers that find the New Brunswick-born songwriter thoughtfully tending to the most important things in life. Andersen’s stage presence is informed by decades of cutting his teeth in dusty clubs, dim-lit bars, and grand theatres all over the world, delivering moving performances that run the gamut from intimate to wall-shaking. In the studio, he’s always brought the same attention to detail and commitment to craft as he has to his live show. The result is a multi-faceted and poignant body of work, which has led him to amass over 33 million streams on Spotify and 30 million views on YouTube.<span><br/></span>In addition to headlining major festivals, clubs and theatres throughout North America, Europe, and Australia, he has shared the stage and toured with Marcus King, Beth Hart, Marty Stuart, Greg Allman, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Randy Bachman, Serena Ryder, Tab Benoit, and more.<span><br/></span>Andersen nabbed the 2013 and 2016 European Blues Awards for Best Solo Acoustic Act, was the first ever Canadian to take home top honours in the solo category at the 2010 International Blues Challenge in Memphis, won the CIMA Road Gold award in 2015, and has won multiple Maple Blues Awards. Matt Andersen & The Big Bottle of Joy was nominated for a Juno Award in 2024.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Joined by opening act, Old Man Luedecke, and a special NWT collaboration with Pat Braden and Norman Glowach!
