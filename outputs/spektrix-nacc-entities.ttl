  schema:description """
	NACC’s 40th Anniversary will be a celebration of exceptional talent and dynamic northern art forms from across the broad expanse of Denendeh. From the great fiddling dynasties flowing deep and swiftly like the great Deh Cho River, to the shining lights of Indigenous theatre born and raised on this very stage, the show will celebrate some of the major milestones and remember some of the brilliant and cutting-edge performers who have shared their art and found their spotlight at NACC. For one halcyon night, community groups and northern stars will join together to bring back the memories and raise their voices in a joyful chorus. Like a giant drum dance or a triumphant handgame, celebrating 40 years of the Northern Arts and Cultural Centre will be a jubilant evening not to be missed.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Runtime: 120 minutes

  schema:description """
	Children of God is about an Oji-Cree family whose children were taken away to a residential school in Northern Ontario. The story of Rita, a mother who was never let past the school’s gate, and her kids, Tom and Julia, who never knew she came, pushes toward redemption. Children of God offers a blend of ancient traditions and contemporary realities, celebrating resilience and the power of the Indigenous cultural spirit. Inspired by First Nations music, Corey Payette’s moving score also includes echoes of provocative Broadway masterpieces such as Fun Home and Next to Normal. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Children of God takes place in two time periods during the 1950s and 1970s, and is set during a time when it mandatory by law for all Indigenous children to attend residential schools. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Touring for the first time since 2019, we are thrilled to announce that the award-winning production, Children of God, is coming to Yellowknife at the Northern Arts and Culture Centre in April, 2025. Performed in English and Anishinaabemowin, this musical is a tremendously impactful piece that explores the history and intergenerational effects of the residential school system, and provides a platform for dialogue about what happened to Indigenous communities in Canada.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This play contains some content that may be triggering for some members of audience.

  schema:name "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun and The Rite of Spring";
  schema:description """
	In Marie Chouinard’s work, The Rite of Spring occupies a special position. In choosing to re-examine this powerful hymn to life, she has created her first choreography based on a musical score. Igor Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring explores a New World and marks the entry of dance into modernity. In this avant-garde work, Marie Chouinard again finds an original pulsation that is essential to her movement. Far from contradicting the rhythm of her dance, the cadence and force of the music inspire, accompany and energize her, forming both the echo and the musical counterpoint of an organic, vigorous and vivid choreography. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 1994, the Compagnie Marie Chouinard was invited to perform The Rite of Spring at the Taipei International Dance Festival in Taiwan, with Igor Stravinsky’s music performed by the Taipei Symphony Orchestra. Because the work’s length made it possible, festival organizers suggested adding Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun to the program. Upon learning that the company did not perform the work using Claude Debussy’s score, the festival encouraged Marie Chouinard to create a new solo version. This is how her Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun came into being. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When he wrote the Afternoon of a Faun in 1876, Stéphane Mallarmé fulfilled a dream: to write poetry for the theatre. The poem’s musicality inspired Claude Debussy to compose Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun in 1894. In 1912, in Paris, Vaslav Nijinski created his first choreography, based on Mallarmé’s poem. In it, he gave life – intense and sensual life – to his own raw and animalistic erotic nature, thereby abruptly breaking with classical tradition. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In her approach to this revolutionary Faun, Marie Chouinard chose to draw on the spirit of Nijinski’s creation. She thus<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Runtime: 70 minutes

	<span class=\"ItalicText\">The nights of our generation are aglow with artificial light. Is there no trace of darkness left on you?</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A NEW MULTI-MEDIA DANCE THEATRE PRODUCTION<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>World After Dark is a new, Dora Mavor Moore Award-nominated production by Shannon Litzenberger Contemporary Dance. It explores the erosion of our relationship to night, inspired by Christopher Dewdney’s popular book Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the world after dark. From the three stages of nightfall to the science of the cosmos, from the birth of nightlife to the empire of dreams, from the biology of nocturnal creatures to the mythology of the night sky, World After Dark takes us on an epic voyage through the mysteries of night, inviting us to reclaim the night – a metaphor for the sensual, the embodied, and the feminine. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Choreographed and Directed by Shannon Litzenberger.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Runtime: 65 minutes
