  schema:name "Alteration";
  schema:description """
	How do we manage to prosperous balances? What happens when they break down? Alteration addresses the transformations that punctuate our lives and our abilities to influence our own destiny and that of others. Aly Keita depicts an oscillating humanity on an intimate and societal level, between stability and uncertainty, anchoring and uprooting, change and resistance, renewal and repetition. The relationship with the other and the complexity of ties lead to the need to hear and rebuild our relationship with ourselves and with our environment. Exploring the meaning of relationships in our society in a wide-ranging way, both interpersonal relationships and those with other-than-human beings, this work opens the way to the construction of possible new links that are formed through ecological and spiritual dimensions. Here, life takes the form of a cycle of transformations. Memories of past experiences and scars – in other words, alteration – are transmuted into a vital breath through reactivating movements, both individual and collective, that revitalize our bodies and rekindle our inner power.

  schema:description """
	<span class=\"BoldText\">A Co-Production with Longshadow Music Society</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Possessing “one of the purest sounds on the six string” (The Listening Sessions), guitarist-composer Brett Hansen has boldly stepped out from his work as one of Canada’s first-call session musicians with a striking debut album of his own, Confluence. Hansen’s compositions showcase his fleet technical skill and cinematic sonic palate, but perhaps most notable is his emotional and dynamic capacity to tell stories without words. Influences from his work in folk, rock, jazz, and orchestral ensembles shine across the album, which has remained on the international jazz charts since its release in 2024 and has garnered critical acclaim, drawing comparison to Pat Metheny and John Abercrombie. Brett Hansen has studied with the likes of Mike Stern, Julian Lage, Oz Noy, Matthew Stevens, Nir Felder, Jim Head, and Rez Abassi. He performs regularly as a part of the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, has toured internationally through Asia, Europe, and Canada, and has performed on hundreds of recordings across genres with some of Canada’s finest musicians across many genres of music. Without a doubt, Brett Hansen a guitarist “deserving of your attention” (The Intelligencer).

Every day after school, she and her best friend Penny run home to watch the show and drool over the hot Link Larkin, much to Tracy's mother Edna's dismay. After one of the stars of the show leaves, Corny Collins holds auditions to see who will be the next teen regular. With the help of her friend Seaweed, Tracy is chosen. She then realizes it’s not fair that Black kids can only dance on the show once a month. With the support of Seaweed, Link, Penny, Motormouth Maybelle, her father, and Edna, she’s determined to integrate the show without denting her ‘do.

	This Lost Dog show reveals the real story of Romeo and Juliet. It turns out they didn’t die in a tragic misunderstanding; they grew up and lived happily ever after.<span><br/></span>Well, they lived. <span><br/></span>Now in their 40s and struggling with a mid-life crisis, they feel constantly mocked by their teenage selves and haunted by the pressures of being the poster couple for romantic love. They decide to confront their current struggles by staging a performance about themselves. Their therapist told them it was a terrible idea. <span><br/></span>With Lost Dog’s blend of dance, theatre, and comedy, this duet directed by Olivier Award nominated Ben Duke takes on our cultural obsession with youth and our inevitable issues with longevity. <span><br/></span>

	WARNING! No Extreme Nudity, Just Extreme Hilarity<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The award-winning improv comedians are back with a new show with more moves and even quicker wits. A fictitious male stripper troupe (played by some of Canada’s best improvisational comedians) perform a sexylarious improv comedy show. They’re trying to be sexy… but it just comes out funny. Constantly grooving and gyrating, they banter with the crowd and perform hilarious improv sketches. Semi-undressed and completely unscripted, The Comic Strippers take off their shirts and take on your suggestions to create an entirely unique show and a whole new genre of comedy.
