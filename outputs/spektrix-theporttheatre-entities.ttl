  schema:description """
	Born in Tisdale, Saskatchewan, BRENT BUTT discovered early that being funny was a good way to get attention. Brent honed his comedy in school and at the age of 20 moved to the city to pursue a career in stand-up. Within months he was headlining top clubs in Toronto, and within a couple years he was touring internationally and appearing at major festivals.  His television specials quickly secured his reputation as one of the funniest people in the country, but he was also busy creating his own TV series – a sitcom called CORNER GAS.  It became an instant hit with unprecedented ratings and numerous accolades including an International Emmy Award nomination, and was named \"Funniest Show on TV\" by TV Guide readers. Canada’s favourite comedy is now shown in over 26 countries including the US.  The final episode of the series was “the highest (rated) on record for a Canadian scripted series since it began keeping track in 1994” Brent’s follow-up series HICCUPS ran for two seasons.<span><br/></span>  <span><br/></span>In 2013 Brent was honoured with a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for his contributions to community and country.  That same year Brent’s first feature film entitled NO CLUE and directed by Carl Bessai was released. Brent wrote, starred in and produced the film under his Sparrow Media banner. The highly anticipated feature film return to Dog River with CORNER GAS: THE MOVIE saw the entire beloved cast reunited to the delight of rabid fans and new fans alike and the movie would go on to receive a special Golden Screen Award at the 2016 Canadian Screen Awards. Re-imagined by creator and star Brent Butt, an all-new animated version of the iconic comedy franchise entitled CORNER GAS: ANIMATED debuted in 2018.  The animated series immediately became the #1 rated show in the history of Canada’s The Comedy Network and a popular main stay on streamer CRAVE TV. So successful in fact, the animated series is now also streaming in the United States on Amazon’s free streaming service IMDB TV and a French language version has been launched. Brent and the series have won multiple Canadian Screen Awards and Leo Awards including Best Animated Program, Best Performance and Best Animation Writing so far.  The fourth and final season of CORNER GAS: ANIMATED is now available.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Most recently Brent’s first novel HUGE debuted to great fanfare immediately becoming the #1 Fiction Bestseller in Canada and it remains on the Top Ten list to date.  With Brent performing, writing, executive producing, and even directing, there is little doubt the future holds many untold achievements for one of Canada’s brightest stars. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

Original score by Frannie Holder.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"This confession... confronts us with the fascinating abysses of devouring and vulnerability. It is the uncompromising affirmation of a female body that no longer has to apologize for aging, for experiencing pleasure, for suffering, or even for being a disturbance. The dance is anything but decorative: it is an expiation, a living archaeology. CONFESSION PUBLIQUE is not to be watched, it is to be received, in a shudder of both trespass and gratitude. A score of paradoxes, where brutality coexists with an almost maternal tenderness.\"</span> - THE ARTCHEMISTS - Peter Loquen<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Content Advisory:</span> This show is for mature audiences (18+). It is based on a series of stories referencing racism, sexual violation, living in an aging body, and the power of transformation. It contains nudity and mature content.

	Crimson Coast Dance opens their Season 2025 – 2026 with Confession Publique.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ideated, directed, and choreographed by Mélanie Demers and brought to life on stage by Angélique Willkie with Marie Jourdenais’ participation, this thought provoking show will grip your sensibilities as it weaves together music, theatre, spoken word and dance in a powerful reflection on humanity’s yearning for validation and the complex interplay of power and vulnerability that evokes. Original score by Frannie Holder.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"This confession... confronts us with the fascinating abysses of devouring and vulnerability. It is the uncompromising affirmation of a female body that no longer has to apologize for aging, for experiencing pleasure, for suffering, or even for being a disturbance. The dance is anything but decorative: it is an expiation, a living archaeology. CONFESSION PUBLIQUE is not to be watched, it is to be received, in a shudder of both trespass and gratitude. A score of paradoxes, where brutality coexists with an almost maternal tenderness.\"</span> - THE ARTCHEMISTS - Peter Loquen<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Content Advisory:</span> This show is for mature audiences (18+). It is based on a series of stories referencing racism, sexual violation, living in an aging body, and the power of transformation. It contains nudity and mature content.

  schema:description """
	Dido and Aeneas, the earliest opera ever written for audiences in London, England,  was first performed in 1689. After more than three centuries, audiences still marvel at Henry Purcell’s genius, as his music brings to life the tragic story we know from Virgil’s epic poem, The Aeneid. Purcell wrote melodies full of longing and pathos, but there are some remarkable, light-hearted musical moments (mostly sung by the chorus) in which Dido and Aeneas’ love is celebrated, the witches dance in glee, characters hastily retreat from an ensuing storm, and a lusty sailor sings his song. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dido’s Lament, ‘When I am laid in earth’, is the most famous aria. This gorgeous melody is so beloved that it is played annually in London by the massed bands of the Guards Division at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday (the Sunday nearest to the 11th of November). This year, we will perform this music on the very same day – Sunday, November 9th. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Four wonderful guest artists will take the roles of Dido (Shanté van Horlick), Aeneas (Carter Martin), Belinda (Andrea Rodall), and the Sorcerer (Michael MacKinnon). You can find our guest artists’ biographies on the choir’s website, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://http:www.malaspinachoir.com\">www.malaspinachoir.com</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The concert also includes Purcell’s ‘If Music Be the Food of Love’, sung by the full choir. A small ensemble will perform Benjamin Britten’s ‘Hymn to St. Cecilia’, an extraordinary work on the bucket list of singers around the world. The piece is a praise to the patron saint of music, whose feast day falls on Britten’s birthdate, November 22nd. All three works are a fitting celebration of music for the month of November. <span><br/></span>

With well over a million downloads on iTunes to their credit, their popularity has also seeped into pop culture, having been mentioned on the network TV shows “The Gilmore Girls”, “Chicago Fire” and “Bad Judge”!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In January, 2004, Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page himself attended a Led Zepagain show at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. He was absolutely astonished at the band’s accuracy stating “It’s amazing how much you sound like us. You must have grown up on this because you were inside the music, and you paid attention to detail in your presentation…I can tell you guys really love our music!”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This encounter led to the members of Led Zepagain attending Led Zeppelin's 2007 Reunion Concert at London's O2 Arena by invitation of Mr. Page as well as a surprise visit from Jason Bonham in March, 2009 as he sat in with the band on their encore performance of the song “Rock and Roll” - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w6noToYSqQ\">Watch the video here</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Led Zepagain was honored to have been featured on AXS TV’s “World’s Greatest Tribute Bands” in 2014 and were asked to come back for an encore performance in March, 2017 to perform the iconic Led Zeppelin “lV” album in its entirety.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Having played nationally and internationally, from Japan to Paraguay and Germany to Mexico City, Led Zepagain regularly performs to packed houses all over the world. We guarantee that from the sound, and the look, to the vintage equipment and costuming, LED ZEPAGAIN will be the closest thing that you will ever see to a live Led Zeppelin performance! Come on out and see what Jimmy Page was talking about.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more about LED ZEPAGAIN please visit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://LinkUrl.com\">www.zepagain.com</a>

As a child, Yamoussa studied the circus performers he saw on European TV and the Nyamakala tradition of circus, practiced by the Fula people of West Africa. He eventually joined Guinea’s original circus company, Circus Baobob, with whom he toured Africa and Europe. Then, in the early 2000's, he was recruited to come to Canada with Cirque Eloize, a Montreal based company, and he also performed with Cirque du Soleil and Cavalia (cirque with horses).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Yamoussa works to pass on and share his values and passions in the circus arts through his school. He teaches various artistic disciplines, such as African dance and traditional music of West Africa, that in turn helps one to master the circus arts.

With a rip-roaring score by Crystle Lightning and Henry Cloud Andrade, and direction by Crystle Lightning, this all-Indigenous concert-style musical infuses hip-hop and comedy into a pow wow-powered love story that’s equal parts hilarious homage and cultural celebration. Captivating audiences across North America, Bear Grease has had over 200 successful performances over 4 incredible years and is currently running Off-Broadway at the St. Luke’s Theatre, New York City until September 7, 2025. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The beloved songs of Grease are revitalized with vibrant cultural expression and Cree (Nêhiyawêwin) language: “Hopelessly Devoted” becomes a soul-stirring Round Dance, “Bear Grease Lightning” bursts with Traditional, Grass, Chicken, and Fancy footwork, and “Wichihin” delivers a powerful new take on “Stand by Me”.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This production takes the audience on an Indigenous joyride through a parallel universe where colonization never existed. While staying true to some aspects of the original musical, the show revamps certain elements: Sandy wears a ribbon skirt, it’s the Pink Aunties (not the Pink Ladies), Rizzo is Rezzo, and Summer Lovin’ turns into Summer Snaggin’. Bear Grease cleverly fuses Doo Wop, Hip-Hop, and Pow Wow styles with Indigenous fashion, history, and humour, and makes each show reflective of the community it is performed in. If laughter is the best medicine, Bear Grease – also the name of a sacred Indigenous medicine – is just what the doctor ordered.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"I will see you on Broadway!\" – George R.R.

Choreographed by internationally acclaimed artist Mauricio Wainrot, this electrifying work fuses bold, athletic movement with Carl Orff’s cantata to create a visceral experience that transcends traditional storytelling.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Set to Orff’s thunderous and evocative score, Wainrot’s choreography unfolds through a series of vignettes that mirror the music’s five movements. Each scene pulses with energy and emotion, shifting seamlessly between moments of erratic intensity, tender romanticism, and unabashed sensuality. With sculptural lighting and costuming, and an ensemble of dancers moving as one powerful organism, Carmina Burana becomes more than performance - it becomes like ritual.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>What emerges is a celebration of the human spirit in all its complexity: raw passion, vulnerability, desire, and joy. It’s a work that demands everything of its dancers and leaves audiences exhilarated, moved, and inspired - proving why it remains a standout in the RWB’s repertoire.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Choreography:</span> Mauricio Wainrot<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Music:</span> Carl Orff, Carmina Burana<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Set & Costume Design:</span> Carlos Gallardo<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Lighting Design:</span> David Morrison<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Associate Lighting Design:</span> Robert Mravnik<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>T’əl: The Wild Man of the Woods</h2><span><br/></span>“T’əl is a powerful fusion of Indigenous storytelling, contemporary ballet, and classical music - rooted in tradition and elevated for the stage.” - The Globe and Mail<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>T’əl: The Wild Man of the Woods marks a bold new chapter in the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s repertoire.

	<span class=\"BoldText\">This year we are celebrating the band’s 25 years of “An East Coast Christmas\", alongside the 25th anniversary of CeltFest Vancouver Island!</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Warning: Heartwarming, Festive Fun Alert!</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The band has sold out small and large venues across our country for a quarter of a century, and we are thrilled to again present the Barra MacNeils’ inaugural performance of this deeply rich Canadian Celtic festive experience as they kick off their 2025 coast-to-coast tour here, on Vancouver Island.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Steeped in Atlantic tradition with strong Celtic roots and musical artistry, this diversely talented group of four brothers and a sister from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, is widely regarded as one of the greatest live acts in the Celtic world. Their captivating vocals, harmonies and extraordinary musicianship are famously featured in their Christmas TV specials which continue to be broadcast on CMT and PBS TV stations. Their numerous critically acclaimed recordings have included their own original songs as well as tried and true standards, both instrumental and vocal. They are 5-time East Coast Music Award winners, and among the many icons they have performed with, they have been the opening act for Celine Dion.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A universal favourite, Barra MacNeils’ East Coast Christmas is a treat for all ages and persuasions. The five siblings are known for their brilliant instrumentals, ringing harmonies and delightful flair for storytelling. Their unique seasonal show is crafted each year to bring a special Celtic spin on traditional favourites and original east coast treasures with songs, stories and dance. Their stunning rendition of “O Holy Night” is just one of the many highlights that brings audiences to their feet. Fans look forward to musical gems like “Ave Maria”, “Christmas in Killarney”, and “Auld Lang Syne” among an array of seasonal delights and originals.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Nothing says Christmas like this uplifting family concert! A collection of soulful seasonal favourites - and so much more – is sure to be a hit with your family, friends or co-workers. Whether this is your first, or your millionth Barra MacNeils live concert experience, it is sure to leave joyous memories that will last you well beyond the season.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On this banner year for both the band and CeltFest, appearing with the Barra MacNeils will be an even more impressive array of local favourites: among them, master piper René Cusson, a dynamic dance troupe, and “surprise” BC guest artists are sure to join in.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	The Strumbellas know that misery loves company, and that if we’re together, even in dark times, there’s some joy in that. Their songs of suffering and celebration date back to their 2012 debut My Father And The Hunter, and the band have obsessively chased big hooks, group vocal exuberance, and folk-rock propulsion through their 2016 breakthrough Hope to 2024’s Part Time Believer. The Juno and iHeartRadio Music Award-winning group’s new song Hard Lines gives listeners an urgent, new take on their iconic mix of intimate feelings with stadium folk sounds.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Determined to use every tool in their arsenal to write a good song, The Strumbellas started by looking inward: random song titles, non-sequitur ideas, scraps of paper, and voice memos of half-sung melodies came from everyone in the band. They then connected with their favourite collaborators, songwriters and producers anywhere from their home in Toronto to Vancouver, Nashville, or LA, to create demos that ranged from campfire-chord whispers to radio-ready productions. The long list was then whittled down by the band along with producer Chad Copelin (LANY, Sasha Sloan, Colony House), who recorded the band at his studio in Norman, Oklahoma. Copelin’s finely honed sonic instincts bring out a newly textured, insistently edgy side to The Strumbellas’ alt-folk stomp.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“We’re living in a lonely world,” says keyboardist Dave Ritter. “Whether it’s work or our home life or our screens, life seems cut up into smaller and smaller pieces all disconnected from each other. Hard Lines is about picking your way through the rubble of contemporary life and the hope that we can build things together again. It’s something we’re reminded of when we gather to write or rehearse songs, and when we get to play for people, that music brings us together, gives us some moments of connection that are hard to find these days.”<span><br/></span>
