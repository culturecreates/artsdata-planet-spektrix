As Rick Mercer says, \"Everyone knows Derek is the funniest man in Canada.\" <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Clearly the critics agree: \"5 STARS - the funniest man on earth\" - Winnipeg Free Press; \"4 STARS - the crowd howled\" - Victoria Times Colonist; \"still the funniest man in Canada\" - Toronto Sun; \"Edwards reigns as the King of Canadian comedy\" - Charlottetown Guardian; \"Derek Edwards is hysterical\" - Calgary Sun; \"Edwards takes stand-up to next stage\" - Georgia Straight; \"the epitome of timing & storytelling\" - Halifax Chronicle Herald; \"the comedian's comedian\" - London Free Press. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>So come on out and join Derek for his latest show, Oxy Moron, as it makes its way across <span><br/></span>Canada.

	A tender journey through loss of identity, the absurdities of life, and the importance of connection.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A moving new Canadian play by Joëlle Rabu & Kelly Wyatt. Directed by Kymme Patrick, with music direction by Nico Rhodes.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Set in a dementia care facility, the play blends humour, grief, and humanity, featuring songs of Harry Nilsson. Joëlle Rabu embodies over a dozen characters alongside Wyatt and Rhodes, bringing to life residents, families, and care aides with honesty and heart.  Not bleak, but deeply human. It is a celebration of connection - reminding us that even at the brink of forgetting, the bonds we share are profoundly meaningful.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Join us for an unforgettable experience that balances light and darkness and invites you to reflect on the beauty of relationships.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>The cast invites you to bring your friends and family, snap a photo at the lobby's photo booth, and make lasting memories together at the performance.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>*Mature subject matter and language - not recommended for young audiences.*<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Talk Back with Cast & Audience following the Saturday Night and Sunday afternoon performances.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">The Creative Team</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Joëlle Rabu</span> (Nanaimo, BC) – Concept Originator, Co-Writer, Performer<span><br/></span>With over four decades in theatre and music, Joëlle Rabu has captivated audiences on stages across five continents. Her theatrical roles include Piaf, Her Songs, Her Loves, Marion Bridge, Anything Goes, John Gray’s Don Messer’s Jubilee, Lies & Legends: The Music of Harry Chapin, Tonight…Piaf, Murder on the Nile, Hot Flashes, Cabaret, and Irma la Douce. She is the recipient of two Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards (with a third nomination), a Juno nomination, the BC Touring Council’s Artist of the Year Award, and the BC Governor General’s “Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Award for Excellence in the Arts and Music.” <span><br/></span>A passionate advocate for mental health awareness, Joëlle drew deeply from her personal experiences with friends and loved ones affected by dementia when creating this play. On stage, she brings to life more than a dozen characters - residents, care aides, and visiting family members - capturing their humour and humanity. Joëlle has released eight independent albums, and her three unpublished children’s books await her in retirement.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://joellerabu.com/\">joellerabu.com</a>   <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Kelly Wyatt</span> (Victoria, BC) – Co-Writer, Performer<span><br/></span>Kelly has always had a natural gift for telling stories, writing with  honesty, heart, and having the ability to illuminate the essence of human nature. A lifelong friend of Joëlle Rabu for over 55 years, she was a natural choice to collaborate on this project. In her early years, Kelly explored modelling and film in Vancouver before devoting herself to family life and a long career in the Victoria school system. Now, she returns to one of her first passions, the stage, where she embodies her half dozen characters with grace and charm, while adding rich vocal harmonies to the ensemble. Kelly is celebrating two exciting 'firsts' this year: co-writing and acting in a play and seeing her debut novel published.  'I Am Enough' by Kelly L. Wyatt was released in September of 2025 to rave reviews and is available through major online platforms and her website: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://kellywyattwrites.com/\">kellywyattwrites.com</a>   <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Nico Rhodes</span> (Nanaimo, BC) – Music Director, Arranger, Performer<span><br/></span>One of Canada’s most sought-after arrangers and music directors, Nico Rhodes brings Harry Nilsson’s timeless songs vividly to life through inventive arrangements that flow seamlessly into the narrative. With more than 50 stage musicals, four original musicals, and over 500 compositions to his credit, Nico’s versatility spans stage, screen, choirs, jazz, and classical ensembles. He has been nominated for two Jessie Awards and five Ovation Awards and is the recipient of Nanaimo’s Emerging Cultural Leader Award. Nico has also produced and performed on Joëlle Rabu’s two most recent recordings. His current touring show Piano Heist has been a runaway hit across Canada and the U.S., and most recently, Nico created Hullabaloo, an annual joy-infused choral production featuring a 100+ voice choir, 5-piece band and guest soloists, performing songs that cross stylistic boundaries in an exhilarating celebration of music. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nicorhodesmusic.com/\">nicorhodesmusic.com</a>   <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Kymme Patrick</span> (Courtenay, BC) – Director<span><br/></span>An award-winning actor, playwright, director, and teacher, Kymme Patrick has built an <span><br/></span>impressive career in theatre, film, and commercials across North America.

  schema:description """
	The times that we are currently facing are, beyond a doubt, harrowing. Through this concert, <span class=\"BoldText\">Island Soul Choir</span> will support you through their music, to guide you through this uncertainty with hope and possibility.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Under the direction of Tom Arntzen, Island Soul Choir will look back at 60s songs by Jimmy Cliff, Sly and the Family Stone, and the Pointer Sisters. They’ll add in songs by Stevie Wonder, Mahalia Jackson, and the newer sounds of Abbey Lincoln and Sarina Partridge, along with a few other songs. By the end, you will come out feeling positive and light-hearted, with hope for a better tomorrow.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The choir is delighted to have two guest artists for this concert:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tai Williams</span>, a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Duncan BC, captivates her audiences with a unique blend of jazz, folk and pop stylings. Her own songs are a scintillating blend of soaring melodies and poignant storytelling inspired by her own life. Tai’s lyricism arouses her audiences’ memories and feelings, drawing them in and capturing their attention. Tai has been performing at local venues and festivals over the past few years, and earlier this year, she performed in The Port Theatre’s Discovery Series. She is currently recording her debut album, to be released later this year.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">TrebleMagic</span> is a women’s a cappella ensemble from the Parksville-Qualicum Beach area. Formerly known as Oceanside A Cappella, these 12 women/friends sing a wide variety of musical genres in three and four-part harmony under the direction of Rosemary Lindsay.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Island Soul Choir is a community choir in its purest sense. The choir welcomes members from all over Vancouver Island, from Victoria to Port Hardy, and from Bamfield and Ucluelet to neighbouring easterly islands including Gabriola, Protection, Salt Spring, Cortes, Lasqueti and Quadra. Members don’t need to have any prior choir experience; they don’t even need to know how to read music—they just need to love to sing.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>NanGo Grannies will partner once again with Island Soul Choir at this concert. They will be selling crafts and baked goods in the theatre lobby before the concert and during the intermission, and all proceeds will be used to support The Stephen Lewis Foundation’s Grandmothers-to-Grandmothers Campaign. Even after almost two decades since the Campaign’s inception, thousands of grandmothers and “grand/younger-others” are more committed than ever to raise awareness, build solidarity, and mobilize funds for community-based organizations that support African grandmothers and the children in their care who have been orphaned by AIDS. We encourage our audience to take advantage of this opportunity to support this truly worthwhile endeavour.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"UnderlineText\">Island Soul Choir Audience Feedback:</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Fantastic! I love the upbeat music!… Loved the range of music and the enthusiasm of the choir!… Well done. A good mix of content… Enjoyed it from beginning to end!… Creative adaptations of traditional scores… Everyone had fun!… Time flew by! Lots of energy… I always find the music uplifting and come away feeling joyous!</span>

With a rip-roaring score by Crystle Lightning and Henry Cloud Andrade, and direction by Crystle Lightning, this all-Indigenous concert-style musical infuses hip-hop and comedy into a pow wow-powered love story that’s equal parts hilarious homage and cultural celebration. Captivating audiences across North America, Bear Grease has had over 200 successful performances over 4 incredible years and is currently running Off-Broadway at the St. Luke’s Theatre, New York City until September 7, 2025. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The beloved songs of Grease are revitalized with vibrant cultural expression and Cree (Nêhiyawêwin) language: “Hopelessly Devoted” becomes a soul-stirring Round Dance, “Bear Grease Lightning” bursts with Traditional, Grass, Chicken, and Fancy footwork, and “Wichihin” delivers a powerful new take on “Stand by Me”.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This production takes the audience on an Indigenous joyride through a parallel universe where colonization never existed. While staying true to some aspects of the original musical, the show revamps certain elements: Sandy wears a ribbon skirt, it’s the Pink Aunties (not the Pink Ladies), Rizzo is Rezzo, and Summer Lovin’ turns into Summer Snaggin’. Bear Grease cleverly fuses Doo Wop, Hip-Hop, and Pow Wow styles with Indigenous fashion, history, and humour, and makes each show reflective of the community it is performed in. If laughter is the best medicine, Bear Grease – also the name of a sacred Indigenous medicine – is just what the doctor ordered.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"I will see you on Broadway!\" – George R.R.

Choreographed by internationally acclaimed artist Mauricio Wainrot, this electrifying work fuses bold, athletic movement with Carl Orff’s cantata to create a visceral experience that transcends traditional storytelling.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Set to Orff’s thunderous and evocative score, Wainrot’s choreography unfolds through a series of vignettes that mirror the music’s five movements. Each scene pulses with energy and emotion, shifting seamlessly between moments of erratic intensity, tender romanticism, and unabashed sensuality. With sculptural lighting and costuming, and an ensemble of dancers moving as one powerful organism, Carmina Burana becomes more than performance - it becomes like ritual.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>What emerges is a celebration of the human spirit in all its complexity: raw passion, vulnerability, desire, and joy.

  schema:description """
	The Strumbellas know that misery loves company, and that if we’re together, even in dark times, there’s some joy in that. Their songs of suffering and celebration date back to their 2012 debut My Father And The Hunter, and the band have obsessively chased big hooks, group vocal exuberance, and folk-rock propulsion through their 2016 breakthrough Hope to 2024’s Part Time Believer. The Juno and iHeartRadio Music Award-winning group’s new song Hard Lines gives listeners an urgent, new take on their iconic mix of intimate feelings with stadium folk sounds.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Determined to use every tool in their arsenal to write a good song, The Strumbellas started by looking inward: random song titles, non-sequitur ideas, scraps of paper, and voice memos of half-sung melodies came from everyone in the band. They then connected with their favourite collaborators, songwriters and producers anywhere from their home in Toronto to Vancouver, Nashville, or LA, to create demos that ranged from campfire-chord whispers to radio-ready productions. The long list was then whittled down by the band along with producer Chad Copelin (LANY, Sasha Sloan, Colony House), who recorded the band at his studio in Norman, Oklahoma.

  schema:description """
	It goes like this: millions of records, a couple dozen hits, a Juno Award (Canada's Grammy) for Band of the Year and ongoing sold-out shows across Canada. Universal Music acknowledges them as \"one of Canada's top five selling bands of all time\" and the Vancouver Sun has called them \"Canadian rock heroes of the first order ... the best performing band in Canada\".<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Then, as now, what makes Trooper what they are is great performances and great pop songwriting.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Trooper's ten studio albums have earned multiple gold and platinum awards and their 6 X Platinum greatest hits, Hot Shots, continues to be one of Universal Music Canada's best selling catalog CDs and one of the country's most enduring party soundtracks. In celebration of the band's 35th anniversary, a totally updated and re-mastered collection - \"Hits From 10 Albums\" - was released, featuring songs spanning the entirety of their recording career. John Kereiff, writing in Gonzo Magazine, dubbed the collection \"THE summer album of 2010.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2012 Trooper songwriters Ra McGuire and Brian Smith were awarded SOCAN's prestigious 'National Achievement Award' to acknowledge their significant and lasting contribution to Canada's songwriting legacy.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"We're Here for a Good Time (Not a Long Time)\", \"Raise a Little Hell\", \"The Boys in the Bright White Sportscar\", \"Two For the Show\", \"Pretty Lady\" \"Good Ol' General Hand Grenade\", \"Round, Round We Go\", \"Santa Maria\", \"Janine\" - just a few of the Trooper hits that, according to writer Ryan Sparks, \"have woven their way into the fabric of this country like no other bands have been able to do. Tune into any radio station from Vancouver to St John's and you're bound to encounter one of their dozen hit radio anthems that are still featured in heavy rotation to this day.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dan Brisbois of canadianbands.com writes, \"They've won practically every Canadian music award possible and they've been dubbed 'Canada's Greatest Party Band' ... and rightfully so.\" Bob Mersereau, author of The Top 100 Canadian Albums wrote, \"Trooper's Hot Shots has been one of the biggest-selling albums in Canadian music history. It has gone six times platinum, and sells consistently, as do tickets to Trooper gigs. There are clubs and festivals across the country where the annual Trooper show is practically an official holiday.\" Indeed, Trooper continues to consistently sell out shows across the country - often performing for three generations of fans - demonstrating that the band and its music remain borderless, timeless, and ageless.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>It's no exaggeration to say that Trooper has become a Canadian legend. They continue to perform their huge collection of hits with the vitality and sense of humour that has served them well on their steady march through the hills and valleys of Canadian Rock and Roll. They were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and Canada’s Walk of Fame in 2023, and the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2024. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Trooper continues with Paul Gogo, ﻿Scott Brown (both well-known Nanaimo musicians), and Clayton Hill, the longest running members of the band. Longtime west coast musician and Trooper guitar tech Steve Crane takes the lead guitar position, and international recording artist Paul Laine performs lead vocals (also a well-known local musician).<span><br/></span>

From the producers of UK’s smash hit show That’ll Be The Day, this phenomenal production tells the story of the most successful musical duo of all time – The Everly Brothers.  Featuring hits such as Bye Bye Love, All I Have To Do Is Dream and Cathy’s Clown, this unique concert-based musical entwines the wonderful, sad yet glorious story of The Everly Brothers. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The show follows the brothers’ rise to fame from humble country beginning to superstardom, through their decade-long feud to their glorious reunion which gave them back to each other, and back to the world. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>With “harmonies from heaven” that inﬂuenced The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and Simon & Garfunkel, The Everly Brothers were unmatched in their talent. Also featuring songs from a couple of the Everly Brothers' good friends, Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Producer Trevor Payne (That’ll Be The Day) says: \"The Everly Brothers were an original and unique act that had a sound like nothing else. Their harmonies were so tight that every group wanted to emulate them. Before that there was a singer, a band and backing vocals, The Everly’s entwined all of them and created ‘the harmony group' \".  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Walk Right Back is the ﬁrst show of its kind to tell this phenomenal story of two brothers and their unforgettable music.
