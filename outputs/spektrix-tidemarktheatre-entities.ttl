	Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. Born and raised in Salluit, a small village in Nunavik which is only accessible by plane, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter. Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with her band Taima, Elisapie’s body of work has been praised many times.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On September 15th 2023, Elisapie unveiled Inuktitut, her fourth solo record. On this album, the Inuk artist covers ten classic rock and pop songs ranging from the 1960’s to the 90’s translated into Inuktitut, her mother tongue. The result is an emotional, autobiographical soundtrack where each song is associated with a loved one or an intimate story. Acclaimed by audiences and critics alike, Inuktitut is the artist's second album to land a shortlist nomination for the Polaris Music Prize. Its success also earned Elisapie a Juno Award in the Contemporary Indigenous Artist of the Year category, as well as five awards at the 2024 ADISQ Gala, and allowed her to play over 70 concerts in Canada, the U.S. and Europe. She also just got nominated for this year’s upcoming Juno Awards for Best Album of the year, as well as for Best Adult Alternative Album of the year.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for creating and producing documentaries and the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day, called Le Grand Solstice. She was also honored with a Canada Post stamp.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Always surrounded by the best musicians from the Montreal indie and folk scenes, Elisapie makes her culture resonate with finesse by mixing modernity and tradition.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Elisapie</span> – Voice<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Jean Sebastien Williams</span> – Guitar<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Joshua Toal</span> – Bass<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Jay Essiambre</span> – Drums<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Jason Sharp</span> – Bass Saxophone<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN0q1taZP_Y\">VIDEO</a></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://elisapie.com\">elisapie.com</a></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets: $30.00 Advance <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees)</span>, $35 at the door

Sung entirely in Wolastoqey, his endangered mother tongue, it would go on to win the 2018 Polaris Music Prize and lead to collaborations with such iconic artists as Yo-Yo Ma and Leslie Feist. His sophomore album Motewolonuwok ᒣᑌᐧᐁᓓᓄᐧᐁᒃ was awarded the 2024 Polaris Music Prize, making Jeremy the first ever two-time winner.

  schema:description """
	For over four decades Powder Blues has been Canada’s leading blues band. The mix of swing, blues, jazz, rock & roll and R&B has an appeal so wide that people from seven to seventy swing side by side at a Powder Blues concert. Over the years the band has toured non-stop through Canada, the United States and overseas, spreading feel-good music that makes folks dance and shout.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Powder Blues debut album, ‘Uncut’, was ignored by major labels who said there was ‘no market for the blues’. Undiscouraged, the band sold it off stage and sent it to radio stations whose switchboards lit up with calls asking, ‘who’s that?’ After selling 30,000 copies in a few weeks, the same record labels competed to distribute this ‘non-commercial’ product. To date Powder Blues have sold over a million records worldwide.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Band highlights include winning Canada’s Juno, headlining the world-famous Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, winning the Blues Foundation Award in Memphis, Tennessee and touring the US and Europe with legends like Willie Dixon, John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, James Brown, Albert Collins, James Cotton and Stevie Ray Vaughn.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Leader, Tom Lavin has written many of the band’s best-known songs including ‘Doin’ It Right’ (‘On the Wrong Side of Town’) and ‘Boppin With the Blues’. Born in Chicago where he worked with local bands and blues legends, Tom moved to Vancouver gigging in the downtown nightclub scene. This led to work as studio musician, song writer, band leader, record producer and film composer.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tom has won BCMIA awards for ‘Guitarist, Singer, Songwriter and Producer of the Year’, a Juno award for ‘Best New Band’ and the American W.C. Handy award. He has over a dozen gold, and platinum records for Powder Blues, Prism, April Wine, Long John Baldry, Amos Garrett, and many others.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>2025 is the band’s 47th Anniversary. Their more than dozen CD titles and DVD continue to sell world-wide making Tom Lavin & the Legendary Powder Blues one of Canada’s longest-standing musical ambassadors.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>www.powderblues.net <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>https://youtu.be/DuqbPDqV9pA<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets: $62 Admission (plus applicable taxes & fees)

  schema:description """
	Join the Campbell River Community Foundation for a thought-provoking evening aimed at transforming conversations around charitable giving, legacy, and estate planning. This is a must-attend event for everyone in the community!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Beginning with a screening of the acclaimed documentary, UnCharitable, traditional constraints that hinder non-profit organizations from achieving their missions are challenged. The Campbell River Community Foundation Vital Signs 2024 survey asked organizations what they need most, and the film offers a powerful validation for much of what was heard.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Following the documentary will be a conversation guided by keynote speaker, Dr. Tom Deans, a global thought leader on generational wealth transfer and author of the best-selling family business book, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Every Family’s Business</span>. Dr. Deans will explore the legal and financial aspects of estate planning, business succession, wealth management and strategic philanthropy in a practical discussion featuring local experts and panelists Lyle Carlstrom of CR Lawyers, Alyssa Thomas of MNP and Shawn Fetter of DeLuca Veale Investment Counsel.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Foundation aims to demystify the planning process for all community members, regardless of the size of their estate. Debunking the common misconceptions around estate planning, the event intends to show that every estate is worth planning for. This evening is about empowering everyone with the knowledge to make thoughtful decisions for their family and community, ensuring their legacy is secure and impactful.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>An exclusive pre-show reception will begin at 5:00 pm, offering ticket holders the chance to mingle with the speakers and representatives from 6 local charities with endowment funds at the Foundation including Greenways Land Trust, Campbell River Hospital Foundation, Campbell River Hospice Society, Campbell River Food Bank, Tidemark Theatre, and Campbell River Museum.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">BIOGRAPHIES:</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Lyle Carlstrom</span> is a barrister, solicitor, notary, and businessman with a social conscience. Among his many accomplishments, he helped create The Estate & Financial Planning Institute, has been involved with the Fairview, Sexsmith, Grande Prairie and Comox Valley Chambers of Commerce. Additionally, he was a founding member of the 1995 Canada Winter Games Host Society, the Community Foundation of Greater Grande Prairie, Grande Prairie Regional College Alumni Foundation, and The Arctic Winter Games Society.

Lyle's practice focuses on solicitor's work in the areas of real estate, corporate-commercial law, estate planning and estate administration. The firm also deals with a broad range of Notary and legal matters. He believes that legal professionals need to be involved in their community and is pleased all firm members share that value.

Outside the office, he enjoys pursuing community initiatives that advance financial education, legacy planning, and youth sports.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Dr. Tom Deans</span> is the author of three books on the subject of family wealth transfers. His first book, Every Family’s Business: 12 Common Sense Questions to Protect Your Wealth, remains the best-selling family business book of all-time - selected by The New York Times as one of the Top Ten Books Business Owners Should Read. The book has sold more than one-million copies in more than 100 countries.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>His second book, Willing Wisdom: Seven Questions Successful Families Ask, reached #2 on the Globe and Mail’s best-sellers List. The book has received critical acclaim for its controversial explanation of why 15 million Canadians do not have a legal will. Willing Wisdom continues to stir debate on the merits of disclosing a will with intended beneficiaries. Willing Wisdom reached #2 on The Globe and Mail Best-seller list and has sold more than 1 million copies world-wide.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In May 2024, Dr. Deans released The Happy Inheritor: How Successful Families Prepare Heirs and Transfer Wealth, the third and final book in his Family Wealth Trilogy. The book examines how many successful families transfer wealth with the help of their advisor through the use of facilitated family meetings to bring predictability and transparency to their estate plans. For families who struggle with this process, the book offers insights into why. This ground-breaking book reinforces the importance of family philanthropy in preparing the next generation for the $300 million that is inherited every day by Canadians.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Deans is a graduate Mount Allison University, McMaster University and earned a Ph.D. from the University of Warwick in England. His books and speeches aren’t just about money and clever tax plans. They’re about giving people the confidence and inspiration to begin important conversations among family and their advisors.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets: $10 Admission <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees)</span>
