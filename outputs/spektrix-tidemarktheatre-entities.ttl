  schema:description """
	The build-up toward saying, “I do,” in a room full of friends and family is stressful for just about everybody. Even so, the anxiety levels for the hero of Lovely Day are completely off the charts. Though his bride-to-be, Virginie (Rose-Marie Perreault), is a steadying influence, Alain (Neil Elias) has no lack of sources for his overwhelming state of consternation. Among the culprits are his unreliable best friend and best man Édouard (Hassan Mahbouba) and his long-divorced parents, Yolande (Hiam Abou Chedid) and Elias (Georges Khabbaz). Yet as the day unfolds, deeper reasons surface and each casts a new light on his actions and reactions. Delightful and poignant in equal measure, the result playfully deconstructs the wedding movie while still providing all the richness and relatability that such stories provide.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>119 minutes<span><br/></span>English, French, Arabic<span><br/></span>Content Advisory: Coarse language, Crude Content<span><br/></span>Not Rated<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets: $21.00 Admission <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees)</span>

	Man-soo (Lee Byung Hun) had it all: a loving wife, two talented children, two happy dogs. Then, after 25 years of dedicated work for Solar Paper, Man-soo is suddenly given the axe. Soon he is falling behind on his mortgage payments and his wife Mi-ri (Son Yejin) insists they put the house up for sale. Man-soo is desperate to scoop a coveted position with Moon Paper, but he knows there are other job seekers who match his pedigree. So he hatches a plan: invent a phony paper company, reach out to each of his rivals, lure them into a meeting… and, one by one, dispatch the competition. Brilliantly scripted by Park Chan-wook, Lee Kyoung-mi, Jahye Lee, and Toronto’s own Don McKellar, No Other Choice is a chilling satire on workplace politics and ruthless status-seeking. In Park Chan-wook’s world, given the right set of circumstances, anyone can be driven to murder. It’s a tough job, but someone’s got to do it.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>139 minutes<span><br/></span>Korean<span><br/></span>Content Advisory: Explicit Violence, Sexually-suggestive scenes<span><br/></span>Rated R<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets:$ 21.00 Admission <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees)</span>

As Rick Mercer says, \"Everyone knows Derek is the funniest man in Canada.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Clearly the critics agree: \"5 STARS - the funniest man on earth\" - Winnipeg Free Press; \"4 STARS - the crowd howled\" - Victoria Times Colonist; \"still the funniest man in Canada\" - Toronto Sun; \"Edwards reigns as the King of Canadian comedy\" - Charlottetown Guardian; \"Derek Edwards is hysterical\" - Calgary Sun; \"Edwards takes stand-up to next stage\" - Georgia Straight; \"the epitome of timing & storytelling\" - Halifax Chronicle Herald; \"the comedian's comedian\" - London Free Press.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>So come on out and join Derek for his latest show, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Oxy Moron</span>, as it makes its way across Canada.

	Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. Born and raised in Salluit, a small village in Nunavik which is only accessible by plane, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter. Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with her band Taima, Elisapie’s body of work has been praised many times.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On September 15th 2023, Elisapie unveiled Inuktitut, her fourth solo record. On this album, the Inuk artist covers ten classic rock and pop songs ranging from the 1960’s to the 90’s translated into Inuktitut, her mother tongue. The result is an emotional, autobiographical soundtrack where each song is associated with a loved one or an intimate story. Acclaimed by audiences and critics alike, Inuktitut is the artist's second album to land a shortlist nomination for the Polaris Music Prize. Its success also earned Elisapie a Juno Award in the Contemporary Indigenous Artist of the Year category, as well as five awards at the 2024 ADISQ Gala, and allowed her to play over 70 concerts in Canada, the U.S. and Europe. She also just got nominated for this year’s upcoming Juno Awards for Best Album of the year, as well as for Best Adult Alternative Album of the year.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for creating and producing documentaries and the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day, called Le Grand Solstice. She was also honored with a Canada Post stamp.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Always surrounded by the best musicians from the Montreal indie and folk scenes, Elisapie makes her culture resonate with finesse by mixing modernity and tradition.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Elisapie</span> – Voice<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Jean Sebastien Williams</span> – Guitar<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Joshua Toal</span> – Bass<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Jay Essiambre</span> – Drums<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Jason Sharp</span> – Bass Saxophone<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN0q1taZP_Y\">VIDEO</a></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://elisapie.com\">elisapie.com</a></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets: $30.00 Advance <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees)</span>, $35 at the door

  schema:name "MA Ensemble";
  schema:description """
	\"MA\" evokes the Zen concept of \"ma,\" the space between things, or the Farsi word \"ma,\" meaning \"us.\" This dual interpretation perfectly encapsulates the essence of the collaboration between Persian instrumental masters Elham Manouchehri and Amir Amiri, while also drawing from the initials of their surnames. The name \"MA\" serves as a reflection of their partnership, with the beginning letters of Manouchehri and Amiri symbolizing the creative fusion of their artistry.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Amir Amiri is a santur (Persian hammered dulcimer) player, composer, and cultural inventor who inhabits a unique musical universe where ancient inspiration, dazzling virtuosity, and bold creativity meet. He composed the soundtrack for Matthew Rankin's film Universal Language, which was short-listed to represent Canada at the Oscars 2025 and won the Directors’ Fortnight Audience Award at Cannes Festival 2024. His latest album Ajdad / Ancestors : Echoes of Persia has been at the top of world music charts since last September. Amiri performs and tours regularly with a vast spectrum of ensembles, enchanting with his signature down-to-earth style and connection with audiences.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Master of several traditional Persian instruments such as Tar, Setar, Shourangiz, and Robab, Elham Manouchehri has collaborated with a variety of musicians from multiple backgrounds and performed across Canada including featuring with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. A resident of Montreal since 2014, she has since immersed herself in the city's cultural fabric and cultivated her musical talents receiving accolades and awards including from the Conseil des arts de Montréal and the Canada Council for the Arts.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Together, Elham and Amir embody the spirit of \"MA\" through their collaboration, creating a space where Persian tradition and contemporary expression converge, celebrating the power of unity and the beauty found in the spaces between. The project’s name is a perfect metaphor for their artistic bond, emphasizing the harmony between sound, silence, and the connection between their musical voices.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Highway 19 Concert Series is supported by the Province of BC through BC Arts Council and BC Live, and the Government of Canada’s Department of Canadian Heritage.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>General admission tickets are $30 with a limited number available for $20 to be accessible for those with limited income.

  schema:description """
	The third installment of the Ramble presented by Highway 19 Concerts and hosted by J. Plank (Jeff Plankenhorn).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Inspired by the late, great Levon Helm’s legendary Midnight Ramble in Woodstock, NY, each Ramble shines a spotlight on three songwriters from emerging and established local talents to show stopping guest headliners, all backed by the One Spot Ramblers, a stellar Vancouver Island house band led by Plank. The Ramble is all about building musical community, and creating unique and unforgettable nights of song and music in our region.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Featuring:<span><br/></span>Paul Pigat - guitar, vocals & songs<span><br/></span>Sue Decker - guitars, vocals & songs<span><br/></span>AJ Lontayao - guitar & vocals<span><br/></span>Maya McCutcheon - vocals<span><br/></span>J. Plank – musical director, host, guitars and vocals<span><br/></span>G. Lee Worden – guitars, keys and vocals<span><br/></span>Rick May – bass<span><br/></span>Dallas Carrie – drums, vocals<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In addition to leading his rockabilly powerhouse trio Cousin Harley, Vancouver’s Paul Pigat has quietly spent a career creating sweet sounds for some of the best artists in the country. Over the years his distinctive guitar playing has graced albums and stages of none other than Jeff Beck, Jackob Dylan, Michael Kaeshammer, Albert Lee, James Burton, Brian Setzer, The Reverend Horton Heat, Neko Case, Jim Byrnes, The Sojourners, Carolyn Mark… and on and on! Blessed with a jazz man’s sheen, a rockabilly heart and a hobo’s soul, there aren’t many genres of music that don’t pull at Pigat’s wayfaring imagination like a magnet. In many ways, it’s a mystery why Paul Pigat isn’t a household name yet. Maybe he’d be a lot easier to pin down if he wasn’t so darn good at so many different things.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Victoria singer-songwriter Sue Decker’s rich and warm voice, distinctive slide guitar playing, and authentic songwriting make for a powerful combination. Ever since learning to play her first guitar chords in a bluegrass jam at the age of thirty-five, Sue has been discovering her truth in song. In 2024 she released her second album “Keeping Time” with producer Steve Dawson which drew comparisons to Ry Cooder and Lucinda Williams.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Still in their teens, multi-instrumentalist AJ Lontayao and vocalist Maya McCutcheon have establishing themselves as tremendous talents to watch in the Campbell River music scene. On guitar and vocals, Lontayao leads the rock band Exit 30, winners of battle of the band accolades all over the Island. Both are regulars at Highway 19’s high school open mic nights and Georgia Strait Jazz Society jams, they also perform as a duo and with their jazz quartet Mood Swings where McCutcheon’s Winehouse-esque pipes are on full display.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>J. Plank (Jeff Plankenhorn) is a highly respected musician known for his skill as a slide guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist, both as a solo artist and as a sought-after session musician. After years in the Austin music scene, Plank now calls Campbell River home while he continues to tour across North America and Europe. Lee Worden, Rick May, and Dallas Carrie round out the house band of Island aces.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Ramble is a family friendly, licensed event.<span><br/></span>Kids are free with a paying adult, teens pay what you can at the door.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Ramble is supported by the Province of BC through the BC Arts Council and BC Live Performance Network.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://paulpigat.com/\">https://paulpigat.com/</a><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://suedecker.com/\">https://suedecker.com/</a><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jplankmusic.com/\">https://jplankmusic.com</a>/<span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.highway19.ca/\">www.highway19.ca</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets: $30.00 Admission <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees) </span>Kids are free with a paying adult, teens pay what you can at the door.

  schema:name "Two Pianos No Rodeo";
  schema:description """
	This isn’t a concert. It’s a piano séance in two acts. Highway 19 Concerts presents Bob Wiseman and Mike Boguski, two of Canada’s most unpredictable keyboard minds are taking turns dismantling and reimagining what a solo piano set can be. One piano. Two artists. Zero cowboy hats.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Bob Wiseman is a punk pianist, lo-fi provocateur, and founding member of Blue Rodeo. Think Thelonious Monk meets William S. Burroughs at a Toronto dive bar. Expect sound collage, biting satire, sonic left turns. Nothing’s off limits.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Current Blue Rodeo pianist Mike Boguski is an ambient soul explorer. A master of restraint and reverie. Piano as landscape. Melody as memory. Quiet storms and cinematic swells. Musical cliff jumping.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Each artist takes the same piano and launches in opposite directions - solo, stripped down, wide open. One piano. Two deeply personal journeys. No safety net. No genre crutches. No rodeo.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Come for the clash of styles. Stay for the communion. This is piano as protest, as prayer or as whatever they feel that night.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"Two Pianos, No Rodeo\" is for those who like their art live, unexpected and slightly dangerous. Think of it less like a show and more like two sonic postcards from different planets sent through the same piano.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Highway 19 Concert Series is supported by the Province of BC through BC Arts Council and BC Live, and the Government of Canada’s Department of Canadian Heritage.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>General admission tickets are $30 with a limited number available for $20 to be accessible for those with limited income. Youth tickets are only $5.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bobwiseman.ca/\">https://www.bobwiseman.ca/</a><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://michaelboguski.com/\">https://michaelboguski.com/</a><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.highway19.ca\">www.highway19.ca</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets: $30/$20 Adult, $5 Youth <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees)</span>

Mitchell and Prism performed on the first anniversary of Elvis Presley’s death.<span><br/></span>More recently, Mitchell was a regular performer on the Vancouver Blues scene, notably with British blues legend Long John Baldry and with St. Louis-born actor/musician Jim Byrnes.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Sue Medley, Juno Award winning Vocalist/Guitarist</span><span><br/></span>A native of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, Sue Medley was signed to PolyGram Records Canada in 1989 and released a self-titled debut CD in 1990. The album was co-produced by Medley and John Mellencamp producer Michael Wanchic and featured strong performances by John Hiatt's band The Goners. In Canada Medley's first single, \"Dangerous Times\" not only pushed her debut album to gold status within a few weeks of release, but was #1 on MuchMusic for two weeks, #1 on the Pop Adult charts for 12 weeks, in the Top 3 of the national album rock chart for six weeks, and earned her a SOCAN Songwriter of the Year Award for most airplay.<span><br/></span>On the heels of the singles \"Dangerous Times\", \"Maybe the Next Time\", \"That’s Life\", and \"Love Thing\", she toured North America the rest of the year opening for Bob Dylan and other high-profile artists. Her second album, Inside Out, was once again co-produced by Medley and Wanchic and was aided by the musical help of slide guitarist Sonny Landreth and drummer Kenny Aronoff. The album, released in 1992, continued her radio success with a handful of additional singles and national tours with such artists as Tom Cochrane, Kim Mitchell and 54.40, keeping her in the spotlight. The first single \"When the Stars Fall\" became a hit on album radio and reached #2 on The Record's chart (being locked out of #1 only by U2). In October 1992 she was invited by John Mellencamp to participate in the Bob Dylan Tribute at Madison Square Gardens in New York City, and performed a duet with Mellencamp on the classic Dylan track \"Like a Rolling Stone\".
