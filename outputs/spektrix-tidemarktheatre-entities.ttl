  schema:description """
	The build-up toward saying, “I do,” in a room full of friends and family is stressful for just about everybody. Even so, the anxiety levels for the hero of Lovely Day are completely off the charts. Though his bride-to-be, Virginie (Rose-Marie Perreault), is a steadying influence, Alain (Neil Elias) has no lack of sources for his overwhelming state of consternation. Among the culprits are his unreliable best friend and best man Édouard (Hassan Mahbouba) and his long-divorced parents, Yolande (Hiam Abou Chedid) and Elias (Georges Khabbaz). Yet as the day unfolds, deeper reasons surface and each casts a new light on his actions and reactions. Delightful and poignant in equal measure, the result playfully deconstructs the wedding movie while still providing all the richness and relatability that such stories provide.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>119 minutes<span><br/></span>English, French, Arabic<span><br/></span>Content Advisory: Coarse language, Crude Content<span><br/></span>Not Rated<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets: $21.00 Admission <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees)</span>

	Man-soo (Lee Byung Hun) had it all: a loving wife, two talented children, two happy dogs. Then, after 25 years of dedicated work for Solar Paper, Man-soo is suddenly given the axe. Soon he is falling behind on his mortgage payments and his wife Mi-ri (Son Yejin) insists they put the house up for sale. Man-soo is desperate to scoop a coveted position with Moon Paper, but he knows there are other job seekers who match his pedigree. So he hatches a plan: invent a phony paper company, reach out to each of his rivals, lure them into a meeting… and, one by one, dispatch the competition. Brilliantly scripted by Park Chan-wook, Lee Kyoung-mi, Jahye Lee, and Toronto’s own Don McKellar, No Other Choice is a chilling satire on workplace politics and ruthless status-seeking. In Park Chan-wook’s world, given the right set of circumstances, anyone can be driven to murder. It’s a tough job, but someone’s got to do it.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>139 minutes<span><br/></span>Korean<span><br/></span>Content Advisory: Explicit Violence, Sexually-suggestive scenes<span><br/></span>Rated R<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets:$ 21.00 Admission <span class=\"ItalicText\">(+applicable taxes & fees)</span>

	Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. Born and raised in Salluit, a small village in Nunavik which is only accessible by plane, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter. Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with her band Taima, Elisapie’s body of work has been praised many times.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On September 15th 2023, Elisapie unveiled Inuktitut, her fourth solo record. On this album, the Inuk artist covers ten classic rock and pop songs ranging from the 1960’s to the 90’s translated into Inuktitut, her mother tongue. The result is an emotional, autobiographical soundtrack where each song is associated with a loved one or an intimate story. Acclaimed by audiences and critics alike, Inuktitut is the artist's second album to land a shortlist nomination for the Polaris Music Prize. Its success also earned Elisapie a Juno Award in the Contemporary Indigenous Artist of the Year category, as well as five awards at the 2024 ADISQ Gala, and allowed her to play over 70 concerts in Canada, the U.S. and Europe. She also just got nominated for this year’s upcoming Juno Awards for Best Album of the year, as well as for Best Adult Alternative Album of the year.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for creating and producing documentaries and the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day, called Le Grand Solstice.

	\"MA\" evokes the Zen concept of \"ma,\" the space between things, or the Farsi word \"ma,\" meaning \"us.\" This dual interpretation perfectly encapsulates the essence of the collaboration between Persian instrumental masters Elham Manouchehri and Amir Amiri, while also drawing from the initials of their surnames. The name \"MA\" serves as a reflection of their partnership, with the beginning letters of Manouchehri and Amiri symbolizing the creative fusion of their artistry.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Amir Amiri is a santur (Persian hammered dulcimer) player, composer, and cultural inventor who inhabits a unique musical universe where ancient inspiration, dazzling virtuosity, and bold creativity meet. He composed the soundtrack for Matthew Rankin's film Universal Language, which was short-listed to represent Canada at the Oscars 2025 and won the Directors’ Fortnight Audience Award at Cannes Festival 2024. His latest album Ajdad / Ancestors : Echoes of Persia has been at the top of world music charts since last September. Amiri performs and tours regularly with a vast spectrum of ensembles, enchanting with his signature down-to-earth style and connection with audiences.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Master of several traditional Persian instruments such as Tar, Setar, Shourangiz, and Robab, Elham Manouchehri has collaborated with a variety of musicians from multiple backgrounds and performed across Canada including featuring with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. A resident of Montreal since 2014, she has since immersed herself in the city's cultural fabric and cultivated her musical talents receiving accolades and awards including from the Conseil des arts de Montréal and the Canada Council for the Arts.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Together, Elham and Amir embody the spirit of \"MA\" through their collaboration, creating a space where Persian tradition and contemporary expression converge, celebrating the power of unity and the beauty found in the spaces between. The project’s name is a perfect metaphor for their artistic bond, emphasizing the harmony between sound, silence, and the connection between their musical voices.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Highway 19 Concert Series is supported by the Province of BC through BC Arts Council and BC Live, and the Government of Canada’s Department of Canadian Heritage.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>General admission tickets are $30 with a limited number available for $20 to be accessible for those with limited income.
