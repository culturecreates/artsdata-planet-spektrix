	</table><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For 50 years, this Canadian musical legend has been capturing in song the essence of human experience – while fiercely striving to make it better.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>One of Canada’s finest artists, Bruce Cockburn has enjoyed an illustrious career shaped by politics, spirituality, and musical diversity. His remarkable journey has seen him embrace folk, jazz, rock, and worldbeat styles while travelling to such far-flung places as Guatemala, Mali, Mozambique, and Nepal, and writing memorable songs about his ever-expanding world of wonders. “My job,” he explains, “is to try and trap the spirit of things in the scratches of pen on paper and the pulling of notes out of metal.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>That scratching and pulling has earned Cockburn high praise as an exceptional songwriter and a revered guitarist. His songs of romance, protest, and spiritual discovery are among the best to have emerged from Canada over the last 50 years. His guitar playing, both acoustic and electric, has placed him in the company of the world’s top instrumentalists. And he remains deeply respected for his activism on issues from native rights and land mines to the environment and Third World debt, working for organizations such as Oxfam, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, and Friends of the Earth. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Throughout his career, Cockburn has deftly captured the joy, pain, fear, and faith<span><br/></span>of human experience in song. Whether singing about retreating to the country or going up against chaos, tackling imperialist lies or embracing ecclesiastical truths, he has always expressed a tough yet hopeful stance: to kick at the darkness till it bleeds daylight. “We can’t settle for things as they are,” he once warned. “If you don’t tackle the problems, they’re going to get worse.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For his many achievements, the Ottawa-born artist has been honoured with 13 Juno Awards, an induction into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, as well as the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award, and has been made an Officer of the Order of Canada. But he never rests on his laurels. “I’d rather think about what I’m going to do next,” says Cockburn. “My models for graceful aging are guys like John Lee Hooker and Mississippi John Hurt, who never stop working till they drop, as I fully expect to be doing, and just getting better as musicians and as human beings.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>His commitment to growth has made Bruce Cockburn both an exemplary citizen and a legendary artist whose prized songbook will be celebrated for many years to come.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $79.50</span> ($69.00 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

In recent years, the acclaimed, award-winning singer-songwriter has seen his profile grow with his breakthrough album, Without People.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Touring behind (2020’s) Without People saw Woods play to his largest audiences to date. That included a stint opening for New Jersey-based retro rockers Gaslight Anthem on their recent reunion tour.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Throughout his distinguished career, Donovan Woods has built a devoted following who cling to the acclaimed songwriter’s every word. Never one to mince words, Woods is one of music’s most vulnerable storytellers and on his forthcoming studio album, Donovan takes that a step further. Honest and unflinching, on Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now, his upcoming seventh studio album, Woods takes a long look inside and isn’t necessarily thrilled with what he sees. For an artist who isn’t afraid to bear his soul, this is as emotionally gritty as he has ever been.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Long known as a masterful storyteller, Woods is at his absolute best on Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now. Across the album’s 12 sparse, intimate songs, Woods finds himself reflecting on the ups and downs he has been through since 2020. His writing allowed him to open up and address the complexities of life that he has been going through.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The album, he notes, serves as “a funeral to the life he was living.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Sonically, Woods decided to take a different approach.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“We had our boundaries and made things sound beautiful within them,” he says. “And what’s left is scrappier than Without People, but I feel like moments of creation are much more accessible on this record.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Many of the songs that comprise Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now focus on the intricacies of friendships and relationships, and looking at the little moments in life. Co-produced with longtime collaborator James Bunton over much of 2023, the album’s delicate nature is reflected in its lyrics.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The psychology of people’s actions always fascinated Woods and informs much of Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now. Focusing on happy, party feelings doesn’t appeal to him.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Once he gets down these darker paths (“It was a warts and all album in a way that I never had done before”), which he admits can be uncomfortable, the songs flow and are universal.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In particular, on the heart-wrenching “Rosemary”. Co-written with Connor Seidel, “Rosemary” contemplates what happens in the aftermath of a heated argument.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Have you ever had a fight by text message? And it’s long, and existential,” he says. “Someone did something wrong and maybe that’s it.” Continuing, he explains that “Rosemary” is about “finally admitting all your faults, showing your actual self and asking, can you still love me? And really wanting an answer either way.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Not everything is doom and gloom.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On “When Our Friends Come Over,” Woods sings lovingly about a couple who rediscover their affection for one another. Featuring Madi Diaz on vocals, the song highlights how two partners are able to appreciate each other in the presence of others. Even though they're going through a rocky patch, Woods shows how even the tiniest of gestures are the true signs of love.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Throughout an album of heart wrenching songs, none hit harder than “Back for the Funeral.” Taking place in a small town, a group of friends who haven’t seen each other in years return to memorialize a schoolmate after they overdosed on pills.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“There's so much writing done about being back in your hometown and what it does to you,” Woods explains. “But there’s the idea that you only go there with bad news—which can be true—and what it does to your feelings about your hometown.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>However, the song poignantly shows that even though someone may return to their hometown for unfortunate reasons, reconnecting with old friends is a positive byproduct of the circumstance.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As Woods continues to work on himself, Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now is the portrait of a songwriter at his creative best. Addressing the truths and pains of life is never easy, and here, he does so in a way that’s brutally honest. After all, that’s what great songwriters do.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_top\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SOtk3HtPYKqxnVuxNBMti\"> Listen to Donovan Woods on Spotify!</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span></h2><span class=\"BoldText\">VIP</span> - CA $192.50 ($172.50 + $2.10 CIF + $17.90 Ticketing Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">P1</span> - CA $56.95 ($47.50 + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 Ticketing Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">P2</span> - CA $51.95 ($42.50 + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 Ticketing Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

The band set the bar in 1986, and they’ve remained the industry leading substitute for The Eagles ever since. Playing to huge outdoor and arena audiences, sharing bills with some of rock’s legends, and going places no tribute band has gone before. A long run by any measure, but it begs the question - what makes HOTEL CALIFORNIA so special? Well, incredible lead vocal similarity, intensely accurate instrumental work, soaring harmonies, and top-flight live performances, just for starters. These are the band’s hallmarks, and the foundation on which their reputation has been built. With over a century of collective professional experience in the band today, they’re still going stronger than ever!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>HOTEL CALIFORNIA’s show has evolved into a masterful celebration of The Eagles’ music. One of the most game-changing song catalogs in the history of rock n’ roll is performed to perfection before your eyes and ears. The band also offers tons of value-added promotional support and materials to every client, and the confidence that industry insiders have in them has made HOTEL CALIFORNIA one of the world’s most accomplished tribute productions. You can check them out any time you like, but you’ll never want to leave.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>If you love The Eagles, then welcome to the Hotel California – you’ve just found the next-best thing.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span></h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular</span> - CA $60.00 ($49.50 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Ticketing Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

	</table><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Jesse Cook Biography:<span><br/></span>Beyond his prolific accomplishments as a beloved Nuevo Flamenco guitarist over the past 25 years, JESSE COOK has honed his skills as a composer, producer, arranger, performer and filmmaker.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>By the numbers, Jesse Cook has ten platinum and gold studio albums with combined sales exceeding two million copies, 700 million streams online, five concert DVDs and live discs, five PBS specials, a library of over 300 YouTube videos, a JUNO Award win and 11 nominations, three Canadian Smooth Jazz Awards, a Gemini Award, and an Acoustic Guitar Magazine Player’s Choice Silver Award to his credit.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Jesse started down many of those diverse paths before he started school.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Born in Paris to photographer John Cook and TV producer-director Heather Cook, young Jesse also lived in Barcelona, where he picked up an interest in flamenco as a toddler. At six, after his parents divorced and he moved to Toronto with his mother, the prodigy attended the prestigious Eli Kassner Guitar Academy. During summers with his father in Arles in France, he soaked up more flamenco from neighbour Nicolas Reyes, leader of the world-renowned Gipsy Kings.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>After attending the Royal Conservatory, York University and Berklee College, a comfortable career as a composer seemed in the cards — until an Ontario cable TV company aired his music on the listings channel. “Their switchboard got flooded with calls,” he recalls. “People even got my number somehow and started phoning me at home and asking for a CD. And I was saying, ‘I don’t have a CD, I’m a background composer guy. I don’t make records.’ <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Seeing opportunity, Cook self-produced Tempest at home using an eight-track recorder and one microphone. Then he delivered the initial run of 1,000 CDs from the plant to the distributor in his car. Those humble beginnings quickly sparked a mighty international career, including an extensive discography of 14 albums so far.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“It turns out I did the thing I said I’d never do, and somehow it worked out. In the U.S., it was a breakthrough gig at the Catalina Jazz Festival, where his playing earned a 10-minute standing ovation, sparked mob scenes — “It was like being The Beatles,” he marvels — and prompted one store to order enough copies of Tempest to land it at No.14 in Billboard.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In Poland, his 2004 live album Montreal took the country by storm. In India, he gained fame after one of his songs was plagiarized for a major Bollywood movie. (“In India, that’s allowed,” he explains. “They call it cultural appropriation — it obviously doesn’t mean the same thing there.”) In Iraq, his instrumentals scored the nightly news.  Elsewhere, they’ve accompanied gymnastics and skating routines at the Winter Olympics. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“In Torino, both the Japanese and the Russian skater competed using the same song. One of them won. I think I should have got bronze,” he jokes. No wonder Cook also quips that his music “has had a way more interesting life” than he’s had.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Lately, that international appeal — reflected in a compositional style that mixes Flamenco with everything from Classical and Jazz to Zydeco, Blues and Brazilian samba — has become something he takes more seriously. “I’ve just always made the music that I love. But if music can come from around the world and interconnect so beautifully to create this beautiful tapestry, maybe there’s something that music can teach us.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Many of Jesse’s records have charted top 10 on the US Billboard Charts. Over the past three decades, thousands of concerts have been performed in dozens of counties. Some diehard fans have seen 20 or more shows.  That fanbase has scaled exponentially with the digital reach his music and content now enjoy.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Suddenly, homebound in 2020, due to the pandemic, Cook doubled down creating content for social media. Connecting with his fans and creating a new YouTube series that amassed 2 Million views a month. A notable accomplishment during this time was the Love in the time of Covid video project.  Jesse created one music video a week often playing all the instruments. The 31 videos of the series have amassed over 35 million views to date.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Sleeves ever rolled up, Cook worked tirelessly with his team to relaunch the “Tempest” Tour when live audiences became possible again in 2022. He performed over 80 shows with 80% attendance rate - well above the industry standard.  More than 100,000 tickets were sold and a five-page article in Guitar Player Magazine reflected this widening appeal.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2023, Jesse’s Libre Tour visited 85 markets.  Jesse was invited to participate in Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Festival of renowned guitarists in Sept 2023. Jesse’s Instagram reels have become viral, with his audience continuing to grow at an exponential rate. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2024 and 2025, the “Jesse Cook Live in Concert” Tour will continue to expand with his growing popularity and the addition of new cities and larger venues.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“What do I call my music? I never know how to answer that question. Mostly I don’t care, as long as it touches people’s hearts” - Jesse Cook<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span></h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular</span> - CA $65.50 ($55.00 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Ticketing Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

You can hear their memories, moments, and emotions in the dusty acoustic guitars, the sparse production, and the graceful harmonies between Jon Middleton and Sierra Lundy. Their experiences as a couple pour into a living and breathing vision for 21st century folk amplified by alternative nuance and unassuming pop appeal. After gathering hundreds of millions of streams and earning widespread acclaim, the JUNO Award-nominated group take another leap forward together on their 2023 Know The Night EP [Nettwerk Music Group]. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“We each bring separate things to the table,” notes Jon. “From the first time we sang together, we instantly reacted like, ‘Wow, this feels so good’. Sierra forces me to be a much better songwriter. There was a connection and synergy when we started harmonizing, and it’s only become stronger.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Much like our relationship, there’s something unique about us singing together,” adds Sierra. “If I’m weak in some way, Jon’s voice will be there. I’m a severe perfectionist, and I’m quite ADHD. I can never finish anything. Having Jon there, he’s so prolific. He’s always getting things done. Both of our personalities forge better music than we could make separately.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>They’ve become quite the presence as a unit too…<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>You can hear, see, and feel their evolution across a series of projects, including EP [2018], We Fall In [2019], Tracks [2020], In That Room [2020], Slow Tide [2021], A Place [2021], and What Remains [2022]. Averaging over 3 million monthly listeners on Spotify, “Down by the Water” reeled in 41.5 million Spotify streams with “Tender Love” at 36.4 million Spotify streams, “I Got You, Honey” at 28.4 million Spotify streams, and “Be Around” at 21.1 million Spotify streams. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Plus, they landed major syncs in Grey’s Anatomy and NETFLIX’s Sweet Magnolias in addition to earning acclaim courtesy of American Songwriter, Atwood Magazine, Exclaim, and PopMatters, among others. Moreover, Ocie Elliott packed countless headline shows and shared stages with Joshua Radin, Sons of The East, Kim Churchill, and Hollow Coves. Not to mention, the pair picked up a nod in the category of “Breakthrough Artist of the Year” at the 2022 JUNO Awards.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>After spending much of 2022 on the road supporting their previous EP What Remains and writing in between, the musicians entered the studio with John Raham behind the board as engineer in 2023 to record Know The Night. Throughout the process, the EP’s central theme crystallized.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“The link between many of the songs is the exploration of light and dark inside of us,” notes Sierra. “You can give into the darkness—hence the name Know The Night—or you can choose to look at life in a different light. Post-COVID, we did so much traveling. Our mental health improved, and we began to think and feel more positively.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The first single “Free” coasts along on breezy guitar as Sierra’s breathy harmonies instantly transfix. She declares, “I am free. I’m free in my mind,” as Jon counters over the soft rhythm of a cymbal. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“No matter how trapped you are at work or by duty, you have a choice to be free in your mind,” says Sierra. “It’s something nobody can take away from you.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“For me, the song is about those moments in life where you’re relaxed yet also excited and recognize a kind of infinite potential,” adds Jon. “The world is your oyster, so to speak.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Then, there’s “This Beautiful Life.” With an upbeat and buoyant spirit, it filters various memories into a sweet and nostalgic anthem.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“The song is a series of moments and vignettes,” adds Jon. “We went to Salt Spring at one point during the spring of 2021. It was stunning. It was in the middle of the Pandemic, and we were finally away from home at a cabin. I was playing guitar out on the porch, and it inspired the song.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Lithe strumming sets the tone for “Come On By.” Jon’s gravelly intonation resounds with an invitation and a plea, “Come on by and make the noise in my mind go quiet.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“It’s about times of feeling down, uninspired, and low,” Jon continues. “You have these certain friends in your life who will take you out of it. You forget your troubles because they make you smile, laugh and feel happy.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the end, Ocie Elliott’s relationship and music are as beautiful as ever.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“There’s a special feeling when I’m singing with Sierra,” Jon leaves off. “It’s hard to describe, but it’s incredible.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Sierra concludes, “We want you to be able to listen to our music and feel like a song is on your side, understands you, knows you, and supports you.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ocieelliott.com\">ocieelliott.com</a> | <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://instagram.com/ocieelliott\">instagram.com/ocieelliott</a> | <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://facebook.com/ocieelliottmusic\">facebook.com/ocieelliottmusic</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $46.45</span> ($37.00 + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

Violinist Misha Keylin has performed in forty-five countries spanning five continents. He has captured special attention with his world-premiere CD series, released by Naxos, of Henri Vieuxtemps’ seven violin concertos and showpieces.  Hailed as “a brilliant cellist” by the legendary Mstislav Rostropovich, Sergey Antonov went on to prove his mentor’s proclamation when he became one of the youngest cellists ever awarded the gold medal at the world’s premier musical contest, the quadrennial International Tchaikovsky Competition.  And pianist Ilya Kazantsev, praised by The Washington Post as “virtually flawless,” has performed as a recitalist and a soloist with orchestras in Russia, Canada, Europe, and the United States, and has earned top prizes at the International Chopin Competition (Russia) and the World Piano Competition (USA). The Trio is a champion of an immense range of repertoire, from the works of the great European tradition to more contemporary American pieces. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Misha Keylin, violin<span><br/></span>Sergey Antonov, cello<span><br/></span>Ilya Kazantsev, piano<span><br/></span>

Costumes by JIMBO (winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race.) <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>ABOUT THE ARTIST:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Hot off a tour to the most prestigious puppet festival in Montreal, Danish-Canadian puppeteer Ingrid Hansen tours her spicy puppetry cabaret after shooting 2 seasons of Fraggle Rock with the Jim Henson Company. She spent a year traipsing through Brooklyn’s parks puppeteering a big orange monster on Sesame’s new Emmy-Award-Winning series ‘Helpsters,’ alongside human actors Andrea Martin, John Oliver, Terry Crews, and Margaret Cho. At home in Victoria, Canada, Ingrid also co-creates puppet theatre with the “big kids” inside federal prisons.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ingrid was born and raised in Kelowna BC by gregarious Danish immigrants.  She grew up stealing apples from the neighbor's orchard, tubing down Mission Creek. She spent every summer of her childhood eating fresh cherries and peaches until she exploded, and she always, always, misses Okanagan fruit.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Utterly magical, insanely inventive, wickedly funny, BEAUTIFULLY TWISTED, and occasionally erotic! ★★★★★” - Free Press<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“GENIUS PHYSICAL COMEDY!” - Entertainment World<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>SHOW CREDITS:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Produced by SNAFU Society of Unexpected Spectacles<span><br/></span>Co-created & Directed by Britt Small<span><br/></span>Co-created & Performed by Ingrid Hansen<span><br/></span>Co-produced by, and with creative contributions from, Kathleen Greenfield<span><br/></span>Costume Design by JIMBO The Drag Clown (James Insell) <span><br/></span>Interstitial Film Editing by Pedro M.

From there, the audience becomes part of the show as they meet characters from Puccini’s La Bohème, Madama Butterfly, Turandot, and Manon Lescaut; Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor; Verdi’s Macbeth and Rigoletto; and R.

In the last five years alone, the Canada-born artist’s full-hearted and soul-searching songwriting has led to such milestones as touring with legends like Stevie Nicks, Miranda Lambert and Shania Twain and taking home two JUNO Awards —all while building up a globe-spanning fanbase irresistibly drawn to her intensely honest storytelling. With her many accolades also including 17 Canadian Country Music Association Awards and two Academy Of Country Music Awards, the Nashville-based rising star now begins a bold new chapter with her most fully realized work to date: a gorgeously sculpted batch of songs that bring a moodier and more unfettered sound to her compassionate lyrical outpouring.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“What I love about making music is the potential for my songs to meet people right where they are, but then leave them feeling a little bit more seen and lifted-up than they were before,” says Townes. “I feel like it’s my job to make sure people come away with some sense of hope, even if it’s just the comfort of knowing that someone else out there feels the same way they do.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The first offering from Townes’ latest body of work, “As You Are” strays sonically from past hits like her gold-certified, chart-topping smash “Somebody’s Daughter” and leans toward a more spacious and hypnotic breed of Americana. In composing the track’s gauzy guitar tones and shapeshifting textures, Townes headed to the Seattle area to collaborate with producer/engineer Ryan Hadlock—a Grammy nominee known for his work with Brandi Carlile, The Lumineers, and seminal alt-rock acts like Blonde Redhead and The Afghan Whigs. “I’d been feeling the need to explore a new sonic direction, something that would hold space for real vulnerability but also allow for more of the indie-rock edge that my band and I organically bring to our shows,” says Townes. Written by Townes, Maggie Chapman (The Highwomen, Wafia) and David Pramik (Joy Oladokun, LANY), “As You Are” ultimately matches its mesmerizing sound with a tender meditation on shame, acceptance, and unconditional love. “The whole time we were working on that song I was thinking about the idea of loving all the parts of someone, especially the parts they’re scared to show to the world,” says Townes. “When I listened back later, it hit me that on a much deeper level I’d written exactly what I’d want to hear when I’m struggling and putting up walls: someone to tell me, ‘Hey, you’re good just as you are. Don’t change a thing.’”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A stunning showcase for her raw yet nuanced vocal work, “As You Are” expands on the boundless generosity of spirit Townes has brought to her songs from the very start. As a little girl growing up in Grande Prairie, Alberta, she first fell in love with music thanks to the eclectic mix of artists her parents played at home (“A lot of Dolly Parton and U2, and whatever else they were controlling the stereo with”), then discovered her passion for songwriting at age 14. “My grandparents gave me a guitar and I started learning the chords I needed to make songs out of what I was writing in my journal,” she recalls, naming singer/songwriters like Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna among her enduring influences. “It was so liberating to take all the things I had a hard time saying out loud and put them into a song—it felt like I’d found a much easier form of communication.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As she sharpened her craft by playing everywhere from fundraisers to hockey games in her hometown, Townes decided to forgo college and pursue a career in music despite her parents’ apprehension. To prove her dedication to her chosen path, she then organized, booked, and secured sponsors for a 32-week-long tour in which she traveled across Canada in a motor home and performed in middle-school and high-school gymnasiums. “I’m a Malcolm Gladwell fan, so I gave my parents my 10,000 hours pitch for why it made sense for me to do the crazy music thing instead of going to school,” she says. “After I finished the tour, my dad drove the 47 hours with me to Nashville and I moved into a little garage apartment, far away from everyone I knew. It was the loneliest time in my life, but it helped me to find my voice in a whole new way.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>During her first few years in Nashville, Townes devoted herself to writing and recording demos spotlighting her radiant voice and endlessly empathetic lyrics. When one of those demos caught the attention of Sony Music Nashville, she inked a deal with the label and set to work on her debut album, The Lemonade Stand— a 2020 LP that delivered standouts like “Jersey on The Wall (I’m Just Asking),” a profoundly moving track<span><br/></span>inspired by Townes’ experience in performing at a New Brunswick high school and learning of a then-recent car crash that took the life of the star of the school’s basketball team. Thanks to the massive success of “Jersey on The Wall” and “Somebody’s Daughter” (a song that tells the imagined backstory of an unhoused girl Townes encountered in Nashville), she soon emerged as the first female artist in Mediabase Canada history to score two No. 1 singles, adding to a fast-growing list of triumphs that also included The Lemonade Stand’s winning Country Album of the Year at the 2021 JUNO Awards. Townes seized that coveted prize again with 2022’s Masquerades, a seven-song project revealing her more introspective side on hits like “When’s It Gonna Happen” and its candid account of the aching frustration that sometimes accompanies single life. Later in 2022, she headed overseas and toured all over Europe and the UK, hit the road with country icon George Strait, and capped off the year by embarking on a train trip across Southern Canada— a 3,000-mile trek in which she played 65 shows in 15 days in support of local food banks. The following April, Townes returned with Train Track Worktapes: an EP mostly made up of songs written on the journey and recorded in the train’s caboose.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When it came time to record “As You Are” and its follow-up singles, Townes spent 10 days at Bear Creek Studios in Washington, where she and Hadlock immersed themselves in dreaming up a sonic backdrop suited to the unhurried contemplation of her lyrics. “Throughout the whole process of working with Ryan I felt more free than I ever had in the studio,” she says. “Instead of trying to fit everything into a specific sound, we let the production breathe and focused on supporting the narrative and the emotion of the song as a whole.” Featuring Townes on acoustic guitar and Hadlock on Moog synth, “As You Are” came to life in collaboration with musicians like cellist Josh Neumann (Joni Mitchell, The Secret Sisters), drummer/percussionist William Mapp (Zach Bryan, Courtney Marie Andrews), and bass violinist Kimo Muraki (Vance Joy, The Strumbellas), all of whom helped shape the track’s sparse but spellbinding soundscape. “As You Are’ came from Ryan telling me to play the song the same way I would if I was just sitting in the living room with some friends,” says Townes. “I pulled out my acoustic and he ran it through an amp with a lot of distortion coming from it—it felt like it sort of put a leather jacket on the song, and added some grit to a very simple emotional statement. And that’s exactly what I was looking for.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>By embracing a more stripped-back and free-flowing sound than she’d ever attempted before, Townes has exponentially magnified the intimacy of her music—an element that’s especially abundant in her live performance. “I think a lot of people come to see me for the more emotional songs, but we also love to have those moments that feel like an explosion of joy, where everyone can have fun and stomp around and forget about everything else for a while,” says Townes, who’s now toured with Keith Urban, Reba, Zac<span><br/></span>Brown Band, and Dierks Bentley. Referring to her live show as a “safe space where everyone can be whoever they are,” Townes is quick to note that the most rewarding moments often occur at the end of the night, when she gets to interact with her fans one-on-one. “To me, the greatest measure of success is the stories that people share with me about how my songs have affected them,” she says. “It just proves how powerful music can be—there can be a door inside you that’s closed for a long time, and then you hear a song that cracks it open a bit, and all of a sudden there’s light coming in. It’s always a reminder to keep creating what feels true to me, so that hopefully it’ll end up making other people feel more understood.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">VIP: $137.70</span> ($123.00 + $2.10 CIF + $12.60 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">P1: $68.50</span> ($58.00 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">P2: $51.95</span> ($42.50 + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

And why would anyone assign themselves such a task? <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As Jim Cuddy discovered making his dazzling new album, All The World Fades Away, that particular songwriting mission was less an option than an imperative, one that came for the Blue Rodeo co-founder out of a rare abundance of time to reflect, tinker, and create. Sure, most rootsy singer-songwriter albums detail what the artist sees looking up, down, and around. But All The World Fades Away goes deeper, its windscreen is wider, maybe because Cuddy is that rare musician with decades to draw from and whose story is very much an arc in progress. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“You sort of enter a dream state when you begin writing. And I’ve begun to wonder why some images have stayed with me over the years and others haven’t. So yes, this album is about looking back,” Cuddy shares from his hometown Toronto.  “However, I tried to make sure the record is affirming of life as it is now, reflecting how much I like where I’m at today. It’s not wrapping up or being nostalgic for old times. It’s just… surveying.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>While most songs on All The World Fades Away map Cuddy’s unique compendium of memories and the emotions they stir, few marshal the sheer impact of the magisterial, tender “Impossible,” one of the album’s standout tracks. “It’s a song for Jill Daum, wife of John Mann of Spirit of the West. She lost her husband quite young.” After beating colorectal cancer in 2011, Mann succumbed to early-onset Alzheimer's disease in 2019 at just 57. \"Jill and John’s son has struggled with mental health and lived on the street for a while.  That’s an enormous amount of difficulty heaped on one person. A parent is only as happy as their least happy child. I ran the song past Jill, who asked her son, who then wrote me a letter saying he understood it was about the undying love a parent has for their child. That was all the endorsement I needed. I have played that song a lot and it’s remarkable who comes and talks to me about it afterwards. You just never know who is struggling with these issues.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Fittingly for an album “surveying” the past, All The World Fades Away explores many relationships. Witness the album’s radiant openers, “Learn to Live Alone” and “You Belong.” Each examines different connections separated by decades but threaded through Cuddy’s personal narrative.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“If I were to look at the evolution of my very long relationship with my wife [actor Rena Polley], we have spent a lot of time apart,” Cuddy says of musically buoyant but slightly tear-stained “Learn to Live Alone,” which soars on his falsetto in the chorus. “Independence has become one of the foundational pieces of our relationship, and it has shaped the way we live. When I see other couples that do everything together, I can’t help but wonder how that’s possible.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Then comes the pensive ballad “You Belong” which chronicles a romance from Cuddy’s early years. “This record was written with no deadline at our little country place during the pandemic. I had a lot of time to examine things and some of those things included past relationships. And yes, what’s described in the song happened,” Cuddy says, referring to bumping into the ex-lover at an event, where she blanked on his name. “I have no intention of rekindling anything but what was established in the time we spent together is as present now as it was then.” Cuddy chuckles when asked Polley’s reaction to the song. “She’s not threatened by it. She knows this is art and not biography.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The prolonged gestation of the three-years-in-the-making All The World Fades Away helps explain Cuddy’s reflective mindset. Hitting pause on his solo record, Cuddy took time to record and tour with Blue Rodeo. However, in the summer of 2023, Cuddy got the band back together at The Woodshed Studio to complete the album. Co-producers Tim Vesely and Colin Cripps - also on guitar - were joined by drummer Joel Anderson, bassist Bazil Donovan, violinist Anne Lindsay, keyboardist Steve O’Connor and a marquee roster of guests including vocalist Jenn Grant. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Colin and I have worked together from the very beginning so that’s very symbiotic. And Tim, who added percussion and vocals across the record, is brilliant. He helps us decide musical questions.”   <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Jenn Grant's involvement with the project expanded beyond her vocal contribution on \"Scars\" after she gifted Cuddy a video for the song.  Her multi-disciplinary work as both a visual artist and a musician gave her a singular perspective on Cuddy’s music. She ended up creating several videos for the album, bringing her unique visual style to support and highlight the powerful songwriting on the album. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Where one finds Cuddy, one often finds Keelor though rarely in the comically smug and sarcastic form captured by the new track “Everyday Angels.” It’s a chiming, guitar and violin–goosed corker that posits Cuddy as our “aw-shucks” protagonist guilelessly musing about this and that while Keelor snidely mocks him in call-and-response vocals. “It certainly has our shared humour,” Cuddy howls. “I sent the song to Greg; he sent it back with a few Beatles-inspired bits and we recorded it.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>He continues, “When Blue Rodeo started, I wrote songs with the intention of playing them live. But as things have gone along, I write them more as short stories. That kind of evolution takes time and concentration, which I enjoyed with this record.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>And where should it be filed in bricks-and-mortar record shops? “I guess I’d like to see it filed wherever John Prine is filed,” Cuddy says. “There’s something perfect about his songs. They have a straightforward harmonic structure and are told simply, but they have impact. That’s what I’m going for, too.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>------ <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As a solo artist and as one of the creative forces in Blue Rodeo, Jim Cuddy has received nearly every accolade Canada can bestow upon a musician including 15 JUNO Awards, and The Order of Canada.  Along with his bandmates in Blue Rodeo, Jim has been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, received the Governor General Performing Arts Award and a Star on the Walk of Fame.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For media inquiries, please contact: <span><br/></span>Warner Music Canada <span><br/></span>Dave Stelling – Director, Communicaions<span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dave.stelling@warnermusic.com\">dave.stelling@warnermusic.com</a> <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">P1: $92.55</span> ($81.00 + $2.10 CIF + $9.45 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">P2: $67.50</span> ($57.00 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

	</table><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The international touring band The Wildflowers are North America's #1 tribute to Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"Who doesn't love Tom Petty?\" bassist Darryell Stone asked himself one day in 2012 while listening to the radio. There was only one answer he could imagine. \"Nobody\". Testing his hypothesis, Stone polled friends, family and fellow musicians how they felt about Petty. The result was always the same. Everybody loves Tom Petty.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>One of these fellow musicians just happened to be Tom Petty's doppelganger, guitarist and lead vocalist Jonathan Guthrie. Guthrie was an avid fan and had always fantasized about being a Heartbreaker. As two seasoned musicians and Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers fans, there was really only one thing for them to do - form a Tom Petty tribute band.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>It wasn't hard for Stone and Guthrie to find skilled musicians excited about playing in a Tom Petty tribute band. Drummer Steve Lucas, formerly of Feverdog and a bandmate of Stone's local band, Theatrix, quickly signed on. Lucas brought with him his M-80's band mate Glenn Freeman. Freeman, who boasts of seeing multiple Tom Petty concerts in the 80's, brought an instrumental cornucopia to the group with keyboards, harmonica, guitar and backing vocals. Lead guitarist Curt Granger rounded out the lineup. With 30+ years experience in Birmingham's local music scene, Granger has played in such circuit bands as Pyrate, Scream Sophie, and his own solo project, as well as creating a line of world-renowned boutique guitar amplifiers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The new Tom Petty tribute band rehearsed with one focus - to recreate the music of Tom Petty with precision, attention to detail, and a reverent respect. Parts were studied in great detail, down to inflections in the very way each word of every lyric was sung.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Performing locally in the first year, it didn't take long for the band to be noticed.

	</table><span><br/></span>Anytime you talk to any of Tommy Emmanuel's fans, whether musicians or civilians, invariably they will speak of not one but two qualities that define his greatness. The first, predictably, is his extraordinary guitar playing. Considered by those in the know to be among this planet's greatest guitarists, his playing is simply miraculous, as it would take three musicians, or more, to do what Tommy does solo. Who else, for example, when playing \"Day Tripper,\" can lay down the rhythm part, dig into the riff and sing the melody all at once on just one acoustic guitar? The exuberance Tommy Emmanuel brings to every note of every song he plays is palpable and infectious. His fans are in love with his unbound talent as a guitarist of multitudes, his ability to play three parts at once, always with pure heart and real soul.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Which brings us to the other aspect of his music always mentioned, and without which the first might not be as powerful or as infectiously appealing: the joy. Yes, joy. Because it's one thing to play these multi-dimensional arrangements flawlessly on an acoustic guitar. But to do it with that smile of the ages, that evidence of authentic, unbridled delight, is an irresistible invitation to feel his music as deeply as he does. \"The joy, he says, \"is there always because I'm chasing it through music. Seeing the surprise in peoples' eyes is worth living and working for... I can't help but play to the people with all my heart, which is overflowing with joy of being in that moment that I've worked all my life for. And here it is!\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Although his expression is instrumental, he comes to the guitar much more like a vocalist, positively singing melodies through the strings. He inhabits the tunes he performs, delivering every nuance and turn of phrase. His own songs are also illuminated always with lyrical melodies that go right to the heart, such as his beautiful ode to his daughter, \"Angelina,\" or his great \"story without words,\" \"Lewis & Clark.\" That they resonate so deeply without words makes sense, as words only go so far. But music, coming from a genuine and joyful source, can go so much farther. Now with The Best of Tommy songs, he brings us a complete collection of his own songs, all rich with ripe melodicism and rendered with joy in real-time.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The inspiration for Tommy was his hero, Chet Atkins. Eventually Tommy met Chet who welcomed him into guitarist knighthood by bestowing upon him the coveted title of CGP (Certified Guitar Player), an honor awarded only to four other humans ever.  From sold out shows all over the world to multiple Grammy nominations, ARIA Awards, IBMA Awards, and countless “Best Acoustic Guitarist” wins in numerous music magazine readers polls…. the world is taking notice.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tommy Emmanuel Front Row Meet & Greet package</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><ul><li> Premium reserved ticket in the front row</li><li> Pre-show Meet & Greet with Tommy Emmanuel CGP</li><li> Autographed 8x10 photo</li><li> Early venue entry</li><li> Early access to merch table</li></ul><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tommy Emmanuel Meet & Greet Package</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><ul><li> Premium reserved ticket in the first 15 rows</li><li> Pre-show Meet & Greet with Tommy Emmanuel CGP</li><li> Autographed 8x10 photo</li><li> Early venue entry</li><li> Early access to merch table</li></ul>------<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>VIP packages powered by Sofar.

Lastly, Dr. Breen will gaze into the crystal ball as we try to imagine the future of rural development in our region. What opportunities lie ahead? How can we harness innovation and community resilience to foster sustainable growth and prosperity in rural areas?

Featuring the work of artists Angela Wood and Kaylyn Hardstaff, this newest edition of the Art@KCT program highlights the work of two Okanagan artists working in diverse mediums.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the Rise exhibition space, Angela Wood presents Rhythm & Flow, a visual symphony of large-scale oil paintings. Wood describes her painting practice as “a form of dance – a careful choreography of brush strokes and colour mixing”. Her intentions are to offer a form of escapism, entrancing viewers with the playful and organic movement in her work.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the Cube exhibition space, Kaylyn Hardstaff presents There is a light that never goes out. The series of graphite drawings focuses on fleeting time, precarious moments, light, shadow and how all of these concepts fit within interior spaces. After moving around Canada a few times, Harstaff has taken an interest in the idea of home, interior domestic spaces, and capturing moments of comfort and joy found in each new space. The exhibition features 16 drawings of the natural light from her bedroom window moving across her first apartment in Halifax between 7 and 8:30 am, documenting the passage of time within her then home.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please join us for a public reception on May 22, 5-7 pm. The artists will be in attendance. Refreshments will be served. Rhythm & Flow and There is a light that never goes out will be on view from May 17 - August 10, 2024 in the lobby of the Kelowna Community Theatre.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For a preview of the artist exhibitions and more details, please see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theatre.kelowna.ca/about/art-kct\">Art@KCT page</a>

In the exhibition, Myatt delves into the historical isolation and seclusion faced by menstruating individuals in ancient Western civilization, emphasizing the creation of sacred spaces for nurturance and creativity. Influenced by Anita Diamant's 1997 novel, 'The Red Tent', Myatt reflects the author's attempt to provide a feminine perspective that addresses gaps in religious texts.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the <span class=\"BoldText\">Cube</span> exhibition space, interdisciplinary artist Asana Hughes presents <span class=\"BoldText\"><span class=\"ItalicText\">You Missed a Spot</span></span>, a sculptural work that addresses the lack of diversity in recent art history. Hughes utilizes a series of 28 books titled 'The World of Art' (1966 - 1969) published by Time-Life to critique the lack of authentic artist representation. As Hughes notes, each book centers on an acclaimed artist, each of them a man and European. <span class=\"ItalicText\">You Missed a Spot</span> encourages viewers to consider the implications of this recorded history, or lack thereof, on contemporary culture.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please join us for a public reception on August 21, 5-7 pm.

It features Jurvanen backed by a veritable Murderer’s Row of Music City pros, including guitar legend (and current Eagle) Vince Gill, pedal-steel maestro Russ Pahl (Kenny Rogers, Don Williams, Kacey Musgraves), bassist Dave Roe (Sturgill Simpson, Dwight Yoakam, Johnny Cash), harmonica player Mickey Raphael (Willie Nelson), bluegrass legend Sam Bush. So yes, you could call this Bahamas’ “country” album, full of songs rooted in familiar Nashville topics like love, death, and automotive vehicles, and topped with extra dollops of teary twang, mandolin-pluckin’, and saloon-door-swinging rhythm. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>But BOOTCUT isn’t simply a Bahamas interpretation of country music, it’s a country-music interpretation of Bahamas that puts a sepia-toned spin on Jurvanen’s signature moves using a genre-less blend of Americana, Bluegrass, and all that Bahamas has been known to embody: the funky finesse, the bizarro guitar solos that sound like they’re beaming in from Mars, and the ever-so-sly storytelling that filters timeless themes through a distinctly modern lens.

Using music, stand-up, and storytelling, Bruce McCulloch takes us on a poetic flyover of his life “pursuing stories” and makes an unspoken agreement with the audience to contemplate the world together. Tales combines Bruce’s knack for elfin’ funny observations with his humanistic yearnings, looking at the bravely stupid things he’s done - and things we all do - to make sense of our messy lives.

Nedda, her husband Canio, and their fellow actors Beppe and Tonio, arrive at a new town, and they explain the show that they will be performing that night: “the troubles of Pagliacco.” The troupe then joins villagers for a drink before the performance, at which Canio reveals that while he plays the clown on stage, in real life he is quickly enraged about the attention his wife receives from other men. Nedda is frightened by Canio’s dark revelation, but later agrees tentatively to elope with Silvio, who is her secret lover. Canio learns of Nedda’s deception, and later that evening, while in character on stage, he acts out his shame, and rage, demanding to know the name of his wife’s love.  Their play ends in violence, both onstage and off, with Canio declaring “La commedia è finita!!” – “The comedy is finished!”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Gianni Schicchi is the scheming title character who plots to gain revenge, riches, and happiness through one extraordinary con. The story begins when the rich Donati family learns that their recently deceased patriarch, Buoso Donati, has left all his wealth to a monastery, much to their dismay. Rinuccio, his nephew, had hoped that his inheritance would enable him to marry his sweetheart, Lauretta, even though she and her father, Gianni Schicchi, are newcomers to Florence and not accepted by the elitist Donati family.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Although initially shunned by the snobby old family, Gianni Schicchi gives in to Rinuccio’s pleas to help the Donati family, and agrees to meddle with the will by impersonating Buoso. And then the hijinks begin!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">What to expect in this production</span><span><br/></span>Opera Kelowna’s production brings these two operas together in a setting that imagines a traveling troupe of players has come to Kelowna in the early 1930s, to provide entertainment and cultural connection to the Italian immigrants who now make their home in rural western Canada. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Over the course of one evening, therefore, both this imagined group of newcomers and our audiences in 2024 are taken on a journey to both deep despair and the heights of hilarity through these two works, both of which draw on the traditions of Italian commedia dell’arte theatre. You will see our actors play the roles of traveling actors who then take on both tragic and comic roles in the two acts of the evening.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Sung in Italian, with projected English translations<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Performed with live orchestral ensemble<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For casting and more information, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.operakelowna.com/\">OperaKelowna.com</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span></h2><table class=\" BorderOn\">

Over a 50-year career, he has released 20 albums and been awarded 11 Junos. His songs Farmer’s Song, Down by the Henry Moore, Whispering Rain and Sweeping the Spotlight Awayare now considered Canadian standards. Murray is also a painter, an author, an actor, a radio host; he's been bestowed an Honourary Doctor of Laws and appointed to The Order of Canada. That’s quite a ride. For many years Murray’s touring had been restricted to Lunch At Allen's, whose members also include Ian Thomas, Marc Jordan and Cindy Church. But with the release of his critically acclaimed Hourglass, he’s back on the road treating concert goers to a seamless blend of old and new.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Here’s what he has to say: “As a songwriter I know that it's not enough to sit in your kitchen and write. Your songs need to be heard. Music is a communicative art and if it isn't brought in front of people there is no way to tell if that end has been met. I like to think of a concert tour as a kind of roving gallery to test your art and your ideas. I try to do my very best to make it worthwhile for folks to be there and to perhaps look at things in a new way when they leave.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>And this, in a nutshell, is the <span class=\"BoldText\">Murray McLauchlan</span> concert experience.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"It might have been a large theatre but it felt like a group of friends sitting in a living room listening to tales from the son who hit the road to share his music ... special, memorable, warm and, quite simply, Murray McLauchlan at his best.\" - Kamloops This Week
