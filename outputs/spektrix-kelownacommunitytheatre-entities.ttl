Doyle’s <span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">“Already Dancing”</span></span> tour begins February 28 at home in St. John’s, Newfoundland, and is set to wrap May 17 in Edmonds, Washington. Tickets go on sale October 24 at 12pm local time.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Joining Doyle on all Canadian dates is the JUNO-winning PEI folk duo <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theeastpointers.com/\">The East Pointers</a>, with Brooklyn indie-folk-pop-Americana outfit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.banditsontherun.nyc/\">Bandits on the Run</a> set to support the U.S. leg. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Doyle has also announced today the upcoming release of his new EP, <span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">Already Dancing</span></span>, coming February 20, 2026. The foot-stomping, fiddle-fueled first single <span class=\"ItalicText\">“Nancy”</span> featuring The East Pointers is out today <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://alandoyle.lnk.to/Nancy\">(LISTEN HERE).</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Says Doyle: <span class=\"ItalicText\">“New Tunes! New Tour! Hitting the road in the new year with The Beautiful Beautiful Band as we take the ‘Already Dancing Tour’ around North America. Come sing some new ones and all the favs with us, with special guests The East Pointers in Canada and Bandits on the Run in the U.S. It’s Gonna Be a Time!”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Doyle is currently starring in the musical Tell Tale Harbour, playing at Toronto’s Royal Alexandra Theatre until November 2. Based on the screenplay “The Grand Seduction” by Ken Scott, and co-written by Doyle, Tell Tale Harbour made its Toronto debut in September after a smash-hit sell-out run at Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown, PEI.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On November 4, Doyle will release his fourth book, <span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">“The Smiling Land: All Around the Circle in My Newfoundland and Labrador,”</span></span> a rollicking insider's guide to the province, told as only Doyle can tell it. Few Canadian musicians are as synonymous with their home province as Doyle is to his – and even fewer once worked as tour guides. In “The Smiling Land,” he reprises his tour- guiding role to welcome the rest of Canada to his home and take readers on an adventure: a freewheeling road trip through Newfoundland, its history and its culture.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">ABOUT ALAN DOYLE:</span><span><br/></span>Alan Doyle is a multifaceted singer-songwriter, going on three decades strong as a musician – first as a member of the much-celebrated band Great Big Sea and now as an internationally acclaimed solo artist. His CV is extensive — he is a published author of four books, a film and TV actor-producer with multiple major credits, and star and co-writer of the musical Tell Tale Harbour. Yet the wildly popular musician from Petty Harbour, Newfoundland, remains most electrifying before a live audience, abetted by his ace band. \"I am the luckiest guy in the world,\" Doyle says. \"It's such a privilege to stand among those players on stage.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 1  $107.59</span>  ($91.50 base price + $2.36 CIF + $13.73 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 2  $84.59</span>  ($71.50 base price + $2.36 CIF + $10.73 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.25 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

Big Sugar was an iron man test of musical endurance set against a backdrop of personal turmoil and creative pressure in the 1990s. The cultural experiment of Detroit blues meets Detroit Rock City meets Kingston Ghetto recipe became a force that burned like a vacant inner-city house fire. The unlikely success of the Roots Rock Reggae crew in Hugo Boss suits during the height of “grunge” bought the creative freedom to drive on. And drive on they have.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>That musical spontaneous combustion continues within every live show. Powered now with passion, laughter and comradery. Big Sugar’s throbbing bass lines, arena rock drums and signature guitar tones bring the songs on “Hemi-Vision” to life reminding us how deeply satisfying a great rock show can be!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Gordie Johnson’s power trio featuring bassist Anders Drerup and drummer Root Valach have forged their musical bond during the wildly successful 500 POUNDS tour. Weaving blues and reggae through the wall of guitars and adding vocal harmonies that invoke Jamaica, Motown or an East Coast kitchen party, Big Sugar endures.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The 30th Anniversary Hemi-Vision Tour is a 2 set performance that sees the entire album performed live for the first time ever followed with a second set of favorites and rarities from the extensive Big Sugar catalogue.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please share the evening of Roots Rock Reggae with Big Sugar!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 1  $80.56</span>  ($68.00 base price + $2.36 CIF + $10.20 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 2  $69.06</span>  ($58.00 base price + $2.36 CIF + $8.70 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 3  $57.56</span>  ($48.00 base price + $2.36 CIF + $7.20 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 4  $46.06</span>  ($38.00 base price + $2.36 CIF + $5.70 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.25 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

This is a man who embodies pluck and wit, lighthearted yet encumbered, and a naivete that somehow remains endearing. As Derek says: In the grand contest of life, he stands proudly as a bona fide \"participant.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Well ... truth be told, there’s a lot more to it than that. From Vegas to St. John's, this Just For Laughs veteran is universally considered to be among the comic elite. Certainly his peers think so, as evidenced by the fact that he's a four-time nominee, and winner of Best Standup Comic - Canadian Comedy Awards, as well as a multiple Gemini nominee for Best Performance in a Comedy. As Rick Mercer says, \"Everyone knows Derek is the funniest man in Canada.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Clearly the critics agree: \"5 STARS - the funniest man on earth\" - Winnipeg Free Press; \"4 STARS - the crowd howled\" - Victoria Times Colonist; \"still the funniest man in Canada\" - Toronto Sun; \"Edwards reigns as the King of Canadian comedy\" - Charlottetown Guardian; \"Derek Edwards is hysterical\" - Calgary Sun; \"Edwards takes stand-up to next stage\" - Georgia Straight; \"the epitome of timing & storytelling\" -Halifax Chronicle Herald; \"the comedian's comedian\" - London Free Press.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>So come on out and join Derek for his latest show, Oxy Moron, as it makes its way across Canada.

At age 19, Gowan achieved an ARCT in classical piano performance from the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As a solo artist, he released six studio albums in the '80s and '90s, leading to a Best Of… greatest hits record in 1997. Gowan’s second album, Strange Animal (1985), was recorded at Tittenhurst Park in England, then the home of Ringo Starr and former home to John Lennon, who recorded his highly influential Imagine album (1971) in the same home studio. Strange Animal went triple platinum in Canada, and the video for “A Criminal Mind” (a song he continues to perform solo and also with Styx) won the Juno Award for Best Video of 1985.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Gowan albums have featured guest appearances from Jon Anderson of Yes, Alex Lifeson of Rush, Jerry Marotta and David Rhodes of Peter Gabriel, Tony Levin of Peter Gabriel and King Crimson, Robert Fripp of King Crimson, and John Sebastian of The Lovin' Spoonful. In 1998, Gowan was invited to play his original piece “Healing Waters” with the BBC Orchestra at the opening of Princess Diana’s Memorial at her home in Althorp, England. Four of Gowan’s songs have been certified with SOCAN (ASCAP) Classic Awards, each having surpassed 100,000 spins on Canadian radio. In 2011 he was awarded a star on the Walk of Fame from his hometown of Scarborough, Toronto Canada.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>As a member of Styx, Gowan has recorded four studio albums, three live DVDs/Blu-rays and toured the world over, playing more than 1,600 shows with the band.

	</table><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Hailing from a small town near Ottawa, Ontario, singer-songwriter Leith Ross (they/them) channels their honest and emotional storytelling through introspective lyrics and a blend of indie folk with alternative and rock sounds. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2020, they first introduced their artistry and independently released their debut Motherwell EP. Recorded live, it received widespread praise from tastemakers and fans alike. They continued to evolve with their viral singles “I’d Have To Think About It” and “We’ll Never Have Sex,” while also maintaining their momentum with a rising social presence. Signing to Republic Records in 2022 lead to their long awaited debut album To Learn the following year. As with all of their music, the songs on To Learn are deeply personal and take them to vulnerable places, exploring themes like queerness, love, relationships, and mental health and rendered in folk-adjacent tones—sometimes with a pop beat or a rock riff, sometimes with just their voice and their guitar alone. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Closing out 2023, they unveiled the deluxe version To Learn, More, including live versions of fan favorites “(You) On My Arm,” “Orlando,” and “To Learn.” Critical acclaim followed from the likes of NME, CLASH, Them., Ones To Watch, and The FADER, who hailed them as “your new obsession.” Beyond tours with Lord Huron, Bahamas, and Helena Deland, they sold out headline shows worldwide, performed at festivals across North America, and received the inaugural “John Prine Songwriter Fellowship” at 2022’s Newport Folk Festival and a nomination for “Alternative Album of the Year” at 2024’s Juno Awards. Now, with over 450 million streams across their catalogue to date, they return with the new emotionally charged single “Grieving,” heralding a highly anticipated new album helmed by hit producer Rostam (Vampire Weekend).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Walking the line between genres like an easy path rather than a tightrope, carried by textural and ethereal songs lifted up by stunning vocals,  Wyatt C. Louis’ debut album Chandler refers to simply their middle name. Louis (they/he), a Plains Cree singer-songwriter born and raised in parts of Treaty Six, now lives in Moh’kinstsís (Blackfoot name for Calgary) and lets that amalgamation of place shine through on these tracks, some of which came to life in the quiet and contemplative days of deep pandemic lockdown. Out via Royal Mountain Records, Chandler is suffused with a soft comfort that glows with feelings of familiarity and ease. Louis found levity through collaboration. A new experience, the result is upbeat yet cozy, the kind of songs that show off Louis’ contradictions of paying homage to the country music ingrained in the geography of their childhood, with an indie and roots spin that makes it something different.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 1  $60.21</span>  ($50.00 base price + $2.36 CIF + $7.85 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 2  $42.96</span>  ($35.00 base price + $2.36 CIF + $5.60 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.36 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

This introductory hands-on workshop invites participants to experience the vibrant energy and rhythms of the bateria — the powerful percussion ensemble of a samba school that drives Rio de Janeiro’s world-famous Carnival parades, often featuring 250–300 drummers performing in exhilarating unison. Participants will learn about samba’s rich history, then dive into an interactive introduction to its core instruments that make up a bateria: surdo, caixa, repinique, tamborim, and chocalho. They’ll explore the fundamentals of samba rhythm, call-and-response patterns, transitions, and breaks — discovering how each part interlocks to create samba’s signature swing (ginga). Focusing on ensemble playing, listening, and groove, the workshop culminates in a full-group experience that captures the energy and collective spirit of a live samba bateria — one of the world’s most vibrant and unifying musical traditions. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/_xTky6TAlaA?si=oVAoeHbnoYe16oDB\">Check out this video: Encontro de Baterias</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">About Negin Bahrami:</span><span><br/></span>For over twenty years, Negin Bahrami has been immersed in the vibrant world of Brazilian samba batucada drumming. Trained in Toronto and Rio de Janeiro, she began her journey in 2002 with renowned percussionist Rick Lazar and soon became a core member of Samba Squad, performing across Canada as well as sharing the stage with Jesse Cook.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2004, after experiencing her first of many Carnivals in Rio, Negin co-founded Batucada Carioca with Brazilian master percussionist Maninho Costa. Together, they helped shape Toronto’s samba scene, performing alongside major Brazilian artists Monobloco and opening for Carlinhos Brown and Ivete Sangalo.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Negin’s dedication to samba has taken her deep into Rio’s blocos and top-tier samba schools, culminating in the honour of parading in the legendary Sambódromo with the bateria of Acadêmicos do Grande Rio under the leadership of Mestre Odilon. In 2013, Negin realized a creative initiative she had spent a year developing — Encontro de Baterias. The project brought together Toronto’s four samba groups for the first time: Escola de Samba de Toronto, Samba Squad, Batucada Carioca, and Samba Elégua. Over 100 drummers were united in one large bateria attempting to recreate the sound and energy of the samba school rehearsals in Rio. Encontro de Baterias was a resounding success and a powerful example of music as a community-driven art form, celebrating collaboration and shared passion.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Now based in Kelowna, Negin continues to celebrate and share the essence of samba batucada drumming. For her, it’s not just music — it’s a rhythm that shapes her identity and fuels her connection to culture and community. She remains dedicated to sharing its spirit and traditions by bringing people together through the music she loves.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Adult  $27.50</span>  ($25.00 base price + $2.50 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Student w/ID  $13.75</span>  ($12.50 base price + $1.25 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">A service fee is added for box office costs, card processing, and taxes. <span class=\"BoldText\">Brazilian Samba Batucada</span> tickets and their applicable fees are non-refundable.</span>

Known internationally for his intimate, innovative works that blend theatre, dance, visual art, and object manipulation, Espinosa invites participants into his creative process—where ‘low-tech’ methods, handmade materials, and a spirit of play generate surprisingly sophisticated theatrical effects. Through practical exercises and experimentation, participants will explore how meaning is created through form, light and sound.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">About David Espinosa:</span><span><br/></span>Bachelor of Acting from E.S.A.D. Valencia in 1998. Since 1994, he has studied Contemporary Dance, Improvisation, CI, and Capoeira in Valencia, Brussels, and Barcelona. He has performed with several dance companies, including Mal Pelo, The Malqueridas, Osmosis cie. (France), Lapsus–Alexis Eupierre, and Sonia Gómez / General Elèctrica. As an actor, he has worked in Tragedy and 2666 by Àlex Rigola; Z, Dukes of Vergara Unplugged Vergara and De los condenados by Sergi Faustino; El Enemigo de la clase by Paul Weibel; and Joan el Cendrós by Carles Alberola, among others.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2006, together with África Navarro, he founded El Local Espacio de Creación, where they created the following works: Mi Gran Obra (2012), Desconcierto nº1 (2011), La Procesadora (2010), Felicidad.es (2009), Desaladas Club (2007), and Propiedad Privada (2005), as well as the street performances Summertime (2008) and Agonías de los imposible (2006). These works have been presented at international festivals such as the Biennale di Venezia, Escena Contemporánea de Madrid, ALT Vigo, BAD Bilbao, TNT de Terrassa, Escena Abierta de Burgos, Ciclo Radicals Lliures Barcelona, Feria de Teatro y Danza de Huesca, Poblenou a Escena, Cena Contemporânea de Brasília and F.I.T. de Dourados (Brasil), as well as on the AECID tour in Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and in numerous theatres and venues across the contemporary Spanish scene.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Adult  $27.50</span>  ($25.00 base price + $2.50 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Student w/ID  $13.75</span>  ($12.50 base price + $1.25 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">A service fee is added for box office costs, card processing, and taxes. <span class=\"BoldText\">La Cosa Espinosa</span> tickets and their applicable fees are non-refundable.</span>

Espinosa<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>At a scale of 1:87, My Great Work captures the grandeur of human existence with the humblest of means.  A marvel of simple, visual storytelling, it connects us to each other with infinite complexity.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Working with the mindset of an architect, Espinosa constructs a vast “mega-production” with miniature figures, objects, and a tabletop that is both stage and world. This intimate performance, designed for just 20 spectators seated around the table, transforms models typically used to plan buildings into a space where ideas, images, and actions unfold with surprising emotional force.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>My Great Work reflects on the precarious conditions under which most artists operate, where creativity often emerges from scarcity rather than abundance. By shrinking an extravagant spectacle down to miniature scale, Espinosa exposes the contradictions of large, high-budget cultural productions: their excess, their fragility, and their relative artistic value.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A playful yet incisive portrait of the world we build and the dreams we chase, My Great Work is as intimate as it is expansive.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/1139180806?share=copy&amp;fl=sv&amp;fe=ci\">My Great Work Trailer</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"UnderlineText\">About the Artist</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">David Espinosa</span> (Elche, 1976)<span><br/></span>Bachelor of Acting from E.S.A.D.

His latest album, The Hammer & The Rose, is a veritable garden of heart; a (mostly) delicate collection of tender folk and stirring soul numbers that find the New Brunswick-born songwriter thoughtfully tending to the most important things in life. Andersen’s stage presence is informed by decades of cutting his teeth in dusty clubs, dim-lit bars, and grand theatres all over the world, delivering moving performances that run the gamut from intimate to wall-shaking. In the studio, he’s always brought the same attention to detail and commitment to craft as he has to his live show, and the result - a multi-faceted and poignant body of work - has led him to amass over 33 million streams on Spotify and 30 million views on YouTube. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In addition to headlining major festivals, clubs and theatres throughout North America, Europe, and Australia, he has shared the stage and toured with Marcus King, Beth Hart, Marty Stuart, Greg Allman, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Randy Bachman, Serena Ryder, Tab Benoit, and more. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Andersen nabbed the 2013 and 2016 European Blues Awards for Best Solo/Acoustic Act, was the first ever Canadian to take home top honours in the solo category at the 2010 International Blues Challenge in Memphis, won the CIMA Road Gold award in 2015, and has won multiple Maple Blues Awards.

Is there only one correct way to speak, an accent that’s better than all the other accents? After years of sitting in silence by fear of judgement, Bianca Richard and Gabriel Robichaud decided to stand up and free themselves from their linguistic insecurity. As an act of resistance, the two Acadians from South-East New-Brunswick take a close look at the scars collected along their journey – acquiring a reputation for being “bad Francophones”.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Through a series of deliciously quirky and expertly researched tableaux, Paler mal reveals humourously - - the prejudices we cultivate around language. By examining what language represents in the construction of our identiy and our imaginary, this elegy for a liberation of speech resonates across boundaries to invite us to embrace the diversity of our parler. – Théâtre La Seizième<span><br/></span>***<span><br/></span>« Qu’est-ce que le « bon » français ? Celui de Paris, de Montréal, de Bruxelles ? Existe-t-il une manière correcte de s’exprimer, un accent au-dessus de tous les autres ? Longtemps réduit·e·s au silence par peur du jugement, Bianca Richard et Gabriel Robichaud ont décidé d’affronter leur insécurité linguistique pour enfin s’en affranchir.

With sleek production reminiscent of Goldfrapp, Bonobo's organic pulse, and Lana Del Rey's moody allure, Ché crafts a soundtrack for those chasing city lights and after-hours reveries. Step into her world, where every beat paints a scene and every melody tells a story. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2023, Ché was featured on a haunting duet with Gord Downie (The Tragically Hip) and made guest appearances on Devin Townsend's Lightwork, setting the stage for her third solo album, The Crowned, co-produced by Bob Rock (Metallica). Clash Magazine praised the record for “fusing pop, soul, and indie elements to produce something potent and original,” while Knotfest called the standout track “Falling Under” a “timeless earworm.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Fresh off a busy year of touring in 2024 to support The Crowned, Ché channeled her passion for alt-pop and synthwave into a new body of work that promises to push her signature sound even further. This spring, she’ll release new material that marks the next step in her ongoing evolution as an artist. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cheaimeedorval.com/\">For more information, CLICK HERE</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $35.00</span> ($28.38 + $2.36 CIF + $4.26 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">30 under 30: $25.67</span> ($20.27 + $2.36 CIF + $3.04 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.36 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

Through its dynamic hybrid of acrobatics, movement and physical theatre, the piece puts forth a surrealist chronicle of the familiar. But far from settling into bored fatalism, this show marvels at the absurdity of the mundane and celebrates life, the same way people desperately dance to the last song before the party ends. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>People Watching is a collective comprising six multidisciplinary artists currently based in Montreal. Each personally established in their field, they have worked for companies such as The 7 Fingers, Circa, Cirque du Soleil and Jacob Jonas the Company. Founded in the tumultuous spring of 2020, they were initially moved to investigate ways in which intimacy could be shared with an audience during a time of profound seclusion. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The inquisitive nature of this creative process led them to fuse their organic acrobatic research with elements of physical theatre and nuanced choreographic work. By providing the awe-inspiring qualities of contemporary circus with a scaffolding of depth and context, People Watching began to establish a body of work that is intimate and inherently human.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Using live performance, film, and photography as a vehicle for their artistic endeavors, they have found local and international recognition, which in turn has fostered collaborations with a multitude of established creatives and companies. Additionally, the collective continues to facilitate workshops while touring, allowing them to foster a cultural exchange with fellow artists and share some of the physical language and performance methods they have developed in the creation of their personal work. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Not only did the six Montreal artists from People Watching give us the festival's favorite show, but they also created one of the most remarkable contemporary circus shows in recent years.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“The fact remains that this collective takes us elsewhere.

Having already sung and collaborated with Stevie Wonder, DJ Champion and Garou under the artist name Marie-Christine Depestre, she now appears in a new light, more authentic and full of life than ever. In reference to the nickname given to her by her family and in homage to her maternal grandmother, this choice of a new stage name is a way for her to fully express her personality, to assert her art and thus to find a form of balance. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Describing herself as a rainbow of soul, her first EP \"Push\" (August 26, 2022, via Ensoul Records) is a colorful journey through jazzy, funk, and pop rhythms with rich and enchanting melodies. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"Tina Leon is a rising star in the R&B and Neo Soul genres whose music has the ability to uplift and inspire. She keeps drawing crowds in and securing her position in the Canadian music scene with her distinctive sound and heartfelt performances.

Over the years the band has toured non-stop through Canada, the US and overseas, sharing their feel-good music.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Powder Blues debut album, ‘Uncut’, was ignored by major labels who said there was ‘no market for the blues’. Undiscouraged, the band sent it to radio stations whose switchboards lit up with calls asking, ‘who's that?’ After selling 30,000 copies in a few weeks, the same record labels competed to sign the band. To date Powder Blues have sold over a million records worldwide.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Highlights include winning Canada's Juno, headlining the Montreux Switzerland Jazz Festival, winning the Blues Foundation Award in Memphis, Tennessee and touring the US and Europe with legends like Willie Dixon, John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, James Brown, Albert Collins, James Cotton and Stevie Ray Vaughn.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Leader Tom Lavin wrote many of the band's best-known songs including ‘Doin’ It Right’ (‘On the Wrong Side of Town’) and ‘Boppin With the Blues’. Born in Chicago, where he played with local bands and blues legends, Tom moved to Vancouver where he worked as studio musician, song writer, band leader, record producer and film composer.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tom has won BCMIA awards for ‘Guitarist, Singer, Songwriter and Producer of the Year’, a Juno award for ‘Best New Band’ and the American W.C.

Its promise—alongside its risks—now forces us to grapple with one of the most consequential debates of the 21st century. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Some argue that AI is a powerful tool and an evolutionary step in human history—one that can offload routine tasks and allow humans to focus on higher-level problem-solving, empathy, and meaningful connection. Others contend that the rapid adoption of AI threatens to erode the foundation of human society, including trust, critical thinking, and authentic relationships, potentially deskilling humanity to a point of no return. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Join this live debate on Sunday, March 1 as leading experts debate whether AI will enhance or diminish the human experience.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ok.ubc.ca/ubc-okanagan-debates/\">https://ok.ubc.ca/ubc-okanagan-debates/</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">Admission is free, pre-registration is required.</span></span><span><br/></span>
