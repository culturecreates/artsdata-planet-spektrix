Through a lens of interconnectivity, Dr. Mayer will explain the complex, bi-directional interactions between our brain, our gut and its microbial inhabitants, and how system disturbances can result in inflammatory changes and an increased risk of disease. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>He'll also discuss the significant role that diet can play in these interactions, and what dietary and lifestyle changes people can adopt to decrease the likelihood of these disturbances. This includes advice on the importance of consuming plants that are grown in soils with a healthy microbiome to increase the health and nutrient content of the plants. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dr. Mayer’s presentation will conclude with an audience Q&A session moderated by Dr. Deanna Gibson, Professor of Biology at UBC Okanagan, followed by a short reception in the Kelowna Community Theatre lobby.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This is a free, community event, but pre-registration is required. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">About the speaker:</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dr. Emeran A.

He has published 430 scientific papers, and is the author of <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Mind Gut Connection, The Gut Immune Connection</span>, and a recipe book titled <span class=\"ItalicText\">Interconnected Plates</span>.

At six, after his parents divorced and he moved to Toronto with his mother, the prodigy attended the prestigious Eli Kassner Guitar Academy. During summers with his father in Arles in France, he soaked up more flamenco from neighbour Nicolas Reyes, leader of the world-renowned Gipsy Kings.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>After attending the Royal Conservatory, York University and Berklee College, a comfortable career as a composer seemed in the cards — until an Ontario cable TV company aired his music on the listings channel. “Their switchboard got flooded with calls,” he recalls. “People even got my number somehow and started phoning me at home and asking for a CD. And I was saying, ‘I don’t have a CD, I’m a background composer guy. I don’t make records.’ <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Seeing opportunity, Cook self-produced Tempest at home using an eight-track recorder and one microphone. Then he delivered the initial run of 1,000 CDs from the plant to the distributor in his car. Those humble beginnings quickly sparked a mighty international career, including an extensive discography of 14 albums so far.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“It turns out I did the thing I said I’d never do, and somehow it worked out. In the U.S., it was a breakthrough gig at the Catalina Jazz Festival, where his playing earned a 10-minute standing ovation, sparked mob scenes — “It was like being The Beatles,” he marvels — and prompted one store to order enough copies of Tempest to land it at No.14 in Billboard.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In Poland, his 2004 live album Montreal took the country by storm. In India, he gained fame after one of his songs was plagiarized for a major Bollywood movie. (“In India, that’s allowed,” he explains. “They call it cultural appropriation — it obviously doesn’t mean the same thing there.”) In Iraq, his instrumentals scored the nightly news.  Elsewhere, they’ve accompanied gymnastics and skating routines at the Winter Olympics. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“In Torino, both the Japanese and the Russian skater competed using the same song. One of them won. I think I should have got bronze,” he jokes. No wonder Cook also quips that his music “has had a way more interesting life” than he’s had.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Lately, that international appeal — reflected in a compositional style that mixes Flamenco with everything from Classical and Jazz to Zydeco, Blues and Brazilian samba — has become something he takes more seriously. “I’ve just always made the music that I love. But if music can come from around the world and interconnect so beautifully to create this beautiful tapestry, maybe there’s something that music can teach us.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Many of Jesse’s records have charted top 10 on the US Billboard Charts. Over the past three decades, thousands of concerts have been performed in dozens of counties. Some diehard fans have seen 20 or more shows.  That fanbase has scaled exponentially with the digital reach his music and content now enjoy.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Suddenly, homebound in 2020, due to the pandemic, Cook doubled down creating content for social media. Connecting with his fans and creating a new YouTube series that amassed 2 Million views a month. A notable accomplishment during this time was the Love in the time of Covid video project.  Jesse created one music video a week often playing all the instruments. The 31 videos of the series have amassed over 35 million views to date.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Sleeves ever rolled up, Cook worked tirelessly with his team to relaunch the “Tempest” Tour when live audiences became possible again in 2022. He performed over 80 shows with 80% attendance rate - well above the industry standard.  More than 100,000 tickets were sold and a five-page article in Guitar Player Magazine reflected this widening appeal.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2023, Jesse’s Libre Tour visited 85 markets.  Jesse was invited to participate in Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Festival of renowned guitarists in Sept 2023. Jesse’s Instagram reels have become viral, with his audience continuing to grow at an exponential rate. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2024 and 2025, the “Jesse Cook Live in Concert” Tour will continue to expand with his growing popularity and the addition of new cities and larger venues.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“What do I call my music? I never know how to answer that question.

She has been praised as having “musical ideas and a style of playing and writing that is on par with the current jazz piano elite: Mehldau, Yaron Herman, Shai Maestro, Fred Hersch”, and has been hailed as “one of the top artists of Montreal, Quebec, or even Canadian jazz.” (Cardin/Brunet, <span class=\"ItalicText\">panm360.com</span>).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In July 2022 Wyatt released her debut album Artifact to excellent critical reviews. Joined by Lex French (trumpet), Adrian Vedady (bass) and Louis-Vincent Hamel (drums) she leads a quartet whose effortless chemistry fosters deep interaction and high intensity. As one reviewer described, “Artifact is filled with melody, spirit, and a joy for playing together that brings the listener hope. This album is a gem. Highly recommended!!” (Richard Kamins, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Step Tempest</span>) <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Kate Wyatt has performed with many recognized and respected musicians, including Kenny Wheeler, Jay Clayton, Ira Coleman, Itamar Borochov, Christine Jensen, Yannick Rieu, Ranee Lee, Don Thompson, Barry Elmes, Al McLean, and the Orchestre national de jazz de Montreal (ONJ).

Her music has been recognized with multiple awards from the Canada Council for the Arts, FACTOR, the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec, and the Conseil des arts de Montréal.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As well as being a passionate performer and composer, Wyatt is a deeply invested music educator.

Giuseppe Verdi and Francisco Maria Piave’s operatic masterpiece tells the story of Violetta Valéry, a celebrated French courtesan who dares to follow her heart despite the weight of society’s expectations and the fragile state of her own health. The opera is inspired by Alexandre Dumas fils’ <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Lady of the Camellias</span>, which was also the source text for the 2001 Baz Luhrman film <span class=\"ItalicText\">Moulin Rouge!</span>.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Opera Kelowna’s production is set in the glamour and excitement of 1920s Paris, wherein a youthful generation revels in a liberated lifestyle, making waves against traditional norms. Against this backdrop, Violetta takes a chance on love and pursues a life with the young Alfredo Germont. Verdi's masterful score moves between vivacious parties and deeply personal moments, balancing carefully between hope and heartbreak. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For full cast and more details visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.operakelowna.com\">www.operakelowna.com</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2>Adult:<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 1: $91.50</span> ($79.95 + $2.10 CIF + $9.45 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 2: $75.90</span> ($65.40 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 3: $65.50</span> ($55.00 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Senior (65+):<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 1: $86.50</span> ($74.95 + $2.10 CIF + $9.45 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 2: $70.90</span> ($60.40 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 3: $60.50</span> ($50.00 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Student (under 18):<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 1: $75.45</span> ($64.95 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 2: $60.90</span> ($50.40 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 3: $49.45</span> ($40.00 + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">*limited pay-what-you-wish tickets available.</span><span><br/></span><ul><li> Pay-What-You-Wish tickets are available ranging from $5.00 - $25.00 in increments of $5.00. </li><li> $2.10 CIF and $1.05 + 15% Service Fee are added to each Pay-What-You-Wish ticket.</li></ul><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

The group will travel the length and breadth of North America headlining shows from July 1st onward. \"If we've learned anything from ten years of touring the world, it's that great music has the ability to transcend time and space in a way that is best described as 'magic,\" says Postmodern Jukebox creator and show director, Scott Bradlee. \"In fact, all of us likely have a song or two that instantly transports us to another place. Our 'Moonlight & Magic' World Tour is meant to celebrate this phenomenon through breathtaking live performances that will be remembered long after the curtain falls.\" <span><br/></span>Concertgoers can expect to enter a parallel musical universe where modern day earworms and iconic pop hits alike are reimagined in classic genres like 1920s jazz, Swing, Doo-wop and Motown, and brought to life by a cast of some of the world’s best singers, dancers, and instrumentalists. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Think “The Great Gatsby” meets “Sinatra at the Sands” meets “Back! …To The Future”. When Bradlee started making YouTube videos that remade the hits of today in the classic styles of yesterday, a “viral” success story was born — one that quickly led to sold out shows across North America and Europe in the Summer of 2014. The touring act received rave reviews from industry publications and world-renowned artists alike. In the years that followed, “PMJ” built a reputation as the “Saturday Night Live of singers” by introducing audiences to dozens of exceptional musical artists and turning them into bonafide stars. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ten years and two billion views on their YouTube channel later, a Postmodern Jukebox show has become something of an annual musical tradition for hundreds of thousands of dedicated fans, all over the world. The rare concert act that appeals across generations, older audience members will fall in love with the timeless sounds and nostalgic sensibilities, while younger fans will be thrilled by the fresh take on current pop culture and the sheer virtuosity of the performers on stage.

With UNISON Milne returns to his first love, exploring the intimacy of the piano trio. The synchronistic relationship Milne has enjoyed with bassist John Hébert since 2010 is matchlessly rounded out with drummer Clarence Penn, who represents complimentary threads within the fabric of Milne’s piano trio philosophy -- the intersection of texture and groove. Their 2020 debut recording, The reMission (Sunnyside Records) won the 2021 JUNO Award for Jazz Album of the Year: Group. Their latest album, Time Will Tell, was just nominated for a 2024 JUNO Award for Jazz Album of the Year: Group.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Group biographies  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A former student of Oscar Peterson, Milne has collaborated with a range of artists including Ralph Alessi, Ravi Coltrane, Andrew Cyrille, Sekou Sundiata, Avery Brooks, Bruce Cockburn, and Cassandra Wilson. He is a distinct and respected voice at the heart of New York’s creative jazz scene. Early in his career, Milne was at the center of the M-BASE Collective as a core member of saxophonist Steve Coleman’s bands during the 1990s. Milne is also active as a composer for classical ensembles as well as scoring for film and television. His credits include seven films by acclaimed actor/director William Shatner and the recent CBC TV documentary Black Life: Untold Stores. In 2024 he premiered his piano quintet with the Isidore String Quartet, commissioned by the Banff International String Quartet Competition. Milne served as the musical director, and as a cast member in the new Showtime series “Fellow Travelers”. He is a Yamaha Artist and sought-after educator, serving as an assistant professor of music at The University of Michigan and the Assistant Director at The School for Improvisational Music.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>John Hébert, originally from New Orleans, has been a highly sought-after New York bassist since the mid-1990s. A former student of Rufus Reid, Hébert has collaborated extensively with pianists Fred Hersch and Andrew Hill, appearing on celebrated recordings from each pianist. He has also performed with Lee Konitz, Paul Bley, John Abercrombie, Kenny Wheeler, Paul Motian, Uri Caine, Bill Stewart, Mary Halvorson, Tomasz Stanko, David Liebman, and Toots Thielemans, among many others. An accomplished bandleader, Hébert’s 2015 Sunnyside release with his quartet Rambling Confessions -- his quartet featuring Milne -- received critical acclaim, including 4.5 stars from Downbeat. Over the past decade, he has been named multiple times as a “Rising Star Acoustic Bassist” in Downbeat’s Critics Poll and has received multiple Grammy nominations.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Clarence Penn is one of the most in demand jazz drummers in the world. A composer, bandleader, and prolific producer, he performs regularly with Maria Schneider, Dave Douglas and Uri Caine. Since 1991 when he arrived in New York City, Penn has placed his unique blend of mega-chops, keen intellect, and heady musicianship at the service of a staggering array of A-list artists including Ellis and Wynton Marsalis, Betty Carter, Stanley Clarke, Steps Ahead, Makoto Ozone and Michael Brecker. His impressive discography includes several hundred studio albums, including Grammy-winning recordings from Randy Brecker and Maria Schneider, representing a 360-degree spectrum of jazz expression. He has toured extensively throughout the United States, the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Southeast Asia. He’s composed music for films and commercials and produced tracks for numerous singers in the pop and alternative arenas. Whether leading his own band or performing as a sideman, Penn brings unfailing versatility, professionalism, and an ability to find creative ways to interpret a global array of styles and idioms. Since 2021, Penn has a new role as a full-time Assistant Professor of Music at University of Central Florida. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“The emotionally complex album that came out of that session owes much to the single-minded focus of the three players as they moved fluently through Milne’s dynamic compositions.” Downbeat Magazine <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $50.00</span> ($41.65 + $2.10 CIF + $6.25 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.10 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

Through its dynamic hybrid of acrobatics, movement and physical theatre, the piece puts forth a surrealist chronicle of the familiar. But far from settling into bored fatalism, this show marvels at the absurdity of the mundane and celebrates life, the same way people desperately dance to the last song before the party ends. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>People Watching is a collective comprising six multidisciplinary artists currently based in Montreal. Each personally established in their field, they have worked for companies such as The 7 Fingers, Circa, Cirque du Soleil and Jacob Jonas the Company.

In the guise of an artist talk, Poulin-Denis embodies a kaleidoscope of possible characters, fragmented and intercut, meticulously choreographed and absolutely unexpected.  Joyful, ironic, insightful and humorous, he reveals himself slowly, then abruptly, and hovers between the reality of a human body and the fictions it can manifest. Poulin-Denis materializes our inner monologues, then shifts the frame. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A 'punchline' is, of course, the culmination of a joke. The set-up gets us thinking one thing and then hits us where we weren’t expecting it. Punch Line is a salute to the imagination of both artist and spectator; to the beauty and insight in our collective imagination. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.grandponey.com/en/projects/punch-line/\">For more information, CLICK HERE</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $45.00</span> ($37.30 + $2.10 CIF + $5.60 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.10 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

Modern classics by Murail, Glass, and Vivier are staples of the ensemble’s repertoire, along with commissioned works by pioneering Canadian composers such as Nicole Lizee, Jocelyn Morlock, Bekah Simms Giorgio Magnanensi, and Jordan Nobles. This evening's repertoire is selected especially for Kelowna audiences and includes contemporary works that are simultaneously innovative and accessible. Audiences will experience completely original compositions, as well as one that remakes a work by Claude Debussy.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In its 30-year history, Standing Wave has commissioned and premiered well over 100 works. The ensemble presents an annual season of concerts in Vancouver, has toured across Canada, and has collaborated with luminary artists such as Kokoro Dance, Ballet BC, Mina Shum, Peter Anderson, Talking Pictures, Veda Hille, and the Git Hayetsk Dancers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Standing Wave’s latest album, 20C Remix (2021), received a Juno nomination for Classical Album of the Year (small ensemble). Standing Wave was named Artist/Ensemble of the Year at the West Coast Music Awards in 2017 and 2022.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Celebrated on stages across Canada, Standing Wave has been featured as part of the PuSh International Performing Arts Festival, the Modulus Festival, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra New Music Festival, the Victoria Symphony’s New Currents Festival, the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, the Montreal New Music Festival, and Ottawa’s Chamberfest. In 2022 the ensemble performed on Winnipeg’s venerable Groundswell Concert Series as well as New Music Concerts in Toronto.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dedicated to fostering the next generations of Canadian composers, Standing Wave created Compocon in 2019. Compocon is a summer intensive for composition students. Mentor composers join ensemble members during this week-long program that culminates in the development of new works by the students for Standing Wave’s ‘Pierrot + Percussion” instrumentation. Standing Wave has been an ensemble in residence at the University of British Columbia School of Music since 2004, working with members of the Composition Faculty to provide readings of student works, offering feedback and suggestions from the standpoint of a conductorless chamber ensemble, as well as open rehearsals and workshops.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Elusive Things Program:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>•	<span class=\"ItalicText\">Still Life with Avalanche</span> (2008) Missy Mazzoli<span><br/></span>•	<span class=\"ItalicText\">Walking in Claude’s Footsteps</span> (1910, arr., 2014), Claude Debussy, arr.

I’m thrilled we get to do it again, and to go coast to coast with one of Canada’s finest talents.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">ABOUT TERRI CLARK:</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>From paying her dues at Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge in Nashville to holding the honor of being the only Canadian female member of the Grand Ole Opry, Terri Clark continues to build an unforgettable legacy primed for the history books of Country music. The multi-JUNO Award winner boasts over five million albums sold, three RIAA Platinum and two RIAA Gold-certified albums, Canadian Gold, Platinum, Double Platinum and Triple Platinum-certified albums, 13 Top 10 singles including six No.1s in Canada and the U.S., 19 CCMA Awards and multiple ACM and CMA Female Vocalist of the Year award nominations. Clark also hosts the internationally syndicated, CMA and ACM Award nominated radio show, “Country Gold with Terri Clark,” which can be heard on radio stations across the USA and Canada. In 2018, Clark was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and most recently in 2023, she was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame – joining the likes of Joni Mitchell, Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette, Neil Young and Shania Twain in one of Canada’s highest honors. Clark has performed for sold-out audiences in both Canada and the U.S., headlining her own shows and joining George Strait, Toby Keith, Brooks & Dunn and Brad Paisley. In 2022 and 2023, Clark hit the road with Reba McEntire, continuing to captivate audiences as she took command of the iconic stages of Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl and more as she looks forward to another year full of touring across the U.S. and Canada. Terri Clark: Take Two is the next chapter in Clark’s long history of successes and accolades. Released in 2024, the eight-song album from the legendary singer, songwriter and guitar-slinger pairs her with some of the biggest stars in music today—including Kelly Clarkson, Carly Pearce, Ashley McBryde, Lainey Wilson, Ben Rector and Cody Johnson—for a duets project reimagining her iconic, chart-topping hits.

In 2017, Paul Brandt was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and Western Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame. His 1996 debut RIAA certified Gold album ‘Calm Before the Storm’ went on to sell one million albums internationally, propelled by the #1 single and wedding classic “I Do”. Stateside, his #5 and #1 charting songs “My Heart Has A History”, and “I Do” were the first to chart by a male Canadian Country artist on the US Billboard Top 20 since 1976. His 12 career albums have spawned hit singles, multiple Album of the Year awards, gold, platinum, and multi-platinum performances. According to Nielsen BDS in 2020, of the Top 25 Canadian Country songs, 6 were released by Paul Brandt, and his song “My Heart Has a History” is the most played Canadian Country song since the chart began. Paul is also the most played Canadian Country Artist on Country Radio in history (Nielsen BDS). He has had 27 top ten songs at Canadian Radio. His song “For You” (Brandt/Rosen) was selected to promote the 2002 major motion picture We Were Soldiers and was performed by Dave Matthews and Johnny Cash. In 2015, Canadian Independent Music Association celebrated Paul’s reaching “Road Gold Status” as a top headliner and major box office draw in Canada, and his EP “Frontier” was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2016 Juno Awards. The hit single “I’m An Open Road” from that collection is certified Gold. His 2019 Canadian tour “The Journey Tour” featured his most recent radio singles “All About Her” (Top 10 Canadian Country Radio) and “Bittersweet” (featuring Lindsay Ell) continue to speak to Brandt’s enduring impact and influence on country music audiences and industry as he played arenas across Canada. During the 2019 Canadian Country Music Awards, Paul was honoured with the Slaight Music Humanitarian of the Year Award for his accomplishments with his “Not In My City” (www.notinmycity.ca) movement, which seeks to end human trafficking with a focus on preventing childhood sexual exploitation. Paul lives with his wife Liz and their two children on The Buckspring Ranch in the foothills of Alberta’s Rocky Mountains.

A veritable soundtrack to a whole generation that will ‘carry you home’ ... maybe not to Birmingham ... but back to a time of tie-dyed t-shirts and elevator shoes, 15¢ coffee and homemade apple pie, dating and dreaming ... By the time The Stampeders get to the first chorus of the first song, everyone will be singing along.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>No seventies group represented Canada's musical identity to the world like The Stampeders. A quick look at Canada's music scene from 1971 until 1976 confirms The Stampeders were truly the country's international musical ambassadors, touring more extensively in Canada and overseas than any other Canadian group during that time.  In 1977 the trio: Rich Dodson (lead guitar), Kim Berly (drums) and Ronnie King (bass) parted company but reunited, fittingly at the Calgary Stampede, 15 years later in 1992. Since then, they’ve been recognized by SOCAN for their Lifetime Achievement, been inducted into the SOCAN Songwriters Hall of Fame on five occasions and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame for their 1971 seminal hit Sweet City Woman.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>In March 2024, just before the Ontario leg of this tour, Ronnie King passed away.  In the final days, while in palliative care, he insisted that his band mates carry on. Dave Chabot, renowned bassist and long-time friend of the band, who was already scheduled to be on the tour to sit in for Ronnie as needed, was the obvious choice.  Still, Ronnie remains a presence at every show, as Rich and Kim share stories from 50-plus years on the road and pay tribute with a retrospective video.    <span><br/></span>                                                                                                                      <span><br/></span>The enduring musical legacy of The Stampeders  ...

	</table><span><br/></span>Anytime you talk to any of Tommy Emmanuel's fans, whether musicians or civilians, invariably they will speak of not one but two qualities that define his greatness. The first, predictably, is his extraordinary guitar playing. Considered by those in the know to be among this planet's greatest guitarists, his playing is simply miraculous, as it would take three musicians, or more, to do what Tommy does solo. Who else, for example, when playing \"Day Tripper,\" can lay down the rhythm part, dig into the riff and sing the melody all at once on just one acoustic guitar? The exuberance Tommy Emmanuel brings to every note of every song he plays is palpable and infectious. His fans are in love with his unbound talent as a guitarist of multitudes, his ability to play three parts at once, always with pure heart and real soul.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Which brings us to the other aspect of his music always mentioned, and without which the first might not be as powerful or as infectiously appealing: the joy. Yes, joy. Because it's one thing to play these multi-dimensional arrangements flawlessly on an acoustic guitar. But to do it with that smile of the ages, that evidence of authentic, unbridled delight, is an irresistible invitation to feel his music as deeply as he does. \"The joy, he says, \"is there always because I'm chasing it through music. Seeing the surprise in peoples' eyes is worth living and working for... I can't help but play to the people with all my heart, which is overflowing with joy of being in that moment that I've worked all my life for. And here it is!\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Although his expression is instrumental, he comes to the guitar much more like a vocalist, positively singing melodies through the strings. He inhabits the tunes he performs, delivering every nuance and turn of phrase. His own songs are also illuminated always with lyrical melodies that go right to the heart, such as his beautiful ode to his daughter, \"Angelina,\" or his great \"story without words,\" \"Lewis & Clark.\" That they resonate so deeply without words makes sense, as words only go so far. But music, coming from a genuine and joyful source, can go so much farther. Now with The Best of Tommy songs, he brings us a complete collection of his own songs, all rich with ripe melodicism and rendered with joy in real-time.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The inspiration for Tommy was his hero, Chet Atkins. Eventually Tommy met Chet who welcomed him into guitarist knighthood by bestowing upon him the coveted title of CGP (Certified Guitar Player), an honor awarded only to four other humans ever.  From sold out shows all over the world to multiple Grammy nominations, ARIA Awards, IBMA Awards, and countless “Best Acoustic Guitarist” wins in numerous music magazine readers polls…. the world is taking notice.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tommy Emmanuel Front Row Meet & Greet package</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><ul><li> Premium reserved ticket in the front row</li><li> Pre-show Meet & Greet with Tommy Emmanuel CGP</li><li> Autographed 8x10 photo</li><li> Early venue entry</li><li> Early access to merch table</li></ul><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tommy Emmanuel Meet & Greet Package</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><ul><li> Premium reserved ticket in the first 15 rows</li><li> Pre-show Meet & Greet with Tommy Emmanuel CGP</li><li> Autographed 8x10 photo</li><li> Early venue entry</li><li> Early access to merch table</li></ul>------<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>VIP packages powered by Sofar.
