His latest album, The Hammer & The Rose, is a veritable garden of heart; a (mostly) delicate collection of tender folk and stirring soul numbers that find the New Brunswick-born songwriter thoughtfully tending to the most important things in life. Andersen’s stage presence is informed by decades of cutting his teeth in dusty clubs, dim-lit bars, and grand theatres all over the world, delivering moving performances that run the gamut from intimate to wall-shaking. In the studio, he’s always brought the same attention to detail and commitment to craft as he has to his live show, and the result - a multi-faceted and poignant body of work - has led him to amass over 33 million streams on Spotify and 30 million views on YouTube. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In addition to headlining major festivals, clubs and theatres throughout North America, Europe, and Australia, he has shared the stage and toured with Marcus King, Beth Hart, Marty Stuart, Greg Allman, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Randy Bachman, Serena Ryder, Tab Benoit, and more. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Andersen nabbed the 2013 and 2016 European Blues Awards for Best Solo/Acoustic Act, was the first ever Canadian to take home top honours in the solo category at the 2010 International Blues Challenge in Memphis, won the CIMA Road Gold award in 2015, and has won multiple Maple Blues Awards.

These films push the boundaries of storytelling and animation through innovative formal exploration. Whether showcasing hand-drawn works, stop-motion with physical objects, or digitally created puppetry, Objects in Motion is always a diverse, unexpected and emotionally impactful selection — from hilarity to pointed social critique — taking us to places we really didn’t think it was possible to go….<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Why “Encore”? This special screening revisits the January 2025 edition of Objects in Motion. We loved it and heard great reviews from festival audiences, so we're bringing it back.  We’ve added another film—a surprise for returning viewers and an added delight for everyone. Don’t miss this chance to experience these unique films in a comfortable chair with great acoustics, cinema quality visuals, and the best company in town.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Before the screening begins, we will give you a first look at the Living Things 2026 Festival lineup—our 10th anniversary edition! Be the first to discover the incredible performances coming to Kelowna in January. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We’d love to meet you, join us for a drink in the upstairs lobby at 6:30pm, the screening starts at 7:00pm.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Adult $30.36</span> ($25.00 base price + $2.10 CIF + $3.26 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Student w/ID $17.23</span> ($12.50 base price + $2.10 CIF + $2.63 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.10 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

The two artists met and lived together in NYC and later Montreal, sharing life and art until the death of Douglas from AIDS in 1996. The culmination of this artistic relationship, “While Waiting” – choreographed by Douglas and performed by Navas – was recognized in 1994 with a Bessie Award (New York Dance and Performance Award). <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The choreographer–soloist will perform on a simple open stage, set with three chairs. There will be movement in the space to the music of Bach, PJ Harvey, Billie Holliday, and Dorothy Moore. He renews his longstanding collaborations with light designer Marc Parent and costume designer Sonya Bayer. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>AVES is a luminous dance ritual of hope and optimism, Navas’ way to pay homage to Douglas. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">José Navas</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A native of Caracas, Venezuela, José Navas moved to New York before settling in Montreal, where he created his first choreography in 1991. Four years later he founded Compagnie Flak. José Navas dances with intensity in solo shows charged with emotion, he constructs abstract and captivating group pieces, and he creates pieces of contemporary ballet with classicism and sensitivity. As guest choreographer for prestigious ballet companies, he created an iconoclastic version of Giselle (2013) for Ballet BC, Watershed (2013) for the National Ballet of Canada, and Dénouement/Auflösung (2015) for the German company tanzmainz. His work has been presented in 30 countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://flak.org/jose-navas/en/repertoire/aves-en/\">For more information on Jose, click here</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $45.00</span> ($37.08 + $2.36 CIF + $5.56 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">30 under 30: $32.82</span> ($26.49 + $2.36 CIF + $3.97 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.36 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

Those partnerships have taught him how to unmake a tune—picking up someone else’s idea and finding new ways to fill it in. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>With his new album Falcon's Heart, he drew his inspiration from classic country songwriting. He’d spend mornings at the rehearsal space with his father’s old guitar in his hands. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>The result is vivid and opalescent—Grass’s keen and heartfelt lyrics lit up by leftfield arrangements and shimmering sound.

Ben-Shalom’s first solo album, Known and Unknown, is set to be released in spring 2025. Ben-Shalom translates from Hebrew as “son of peace.” A desire to build connection and community is at the heart of the project. Known and Unknown may be the most meaningful and heartfelt work of his career to date. A bold, avant-folk record drenched in Jewish tradition and ripe for this current moment in a world longing to feel connected. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ben-Shalom has released seven albums with various ensembles, been nominated for a JUNO Award, won a Western Canadian Music Award, and performed on stages across North America. His work has been featured by broadcasters across much of the English-speaking world. Along the way he’s collaborated with Canadian icons, having sung a duet with Bif Naked and played banjo with Tegan and Sara. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ben-Shalom is part of a movement of contemporary Jewish artists strengthening their community and building bridges of shared humanity with a wider audience. Ben-Shalom understands the desire to probe the deepest mysteries and to search for meaning in our lives as a universal human experience. Ben-Shalom views his music as an act of engaging with the oral tradition of his ancestors. His songs place him in a lineage of storytelling that stretches back to the beginnings of shared human thought. Diving into this rich tradition has had a profound impact on Ben-Shalom. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $40.00</span> ($32.73 + $2.36 CIF + $4.91 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">30 under 30: $29.25</span> ($23.38 + $2.36 CIF + $3.51 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.36 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

Through its dynamic hybrid of acrobatics, movement and physical theatre, the piece puts forth a surrealist chronicle of the familiar. But far from settling into bored fatalism, this show marvels at the absurdity of the mundane and celebrates life, the same way people desperately dance to the last song before the party ends. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>People Watching is a collective comprising six multidisciplinary artists currently based in Montreal. Each personally established in their field, they have worked for companies such as The 7 Fingers, Circa, Cirque du Soleil and Jacob Jonas the Company. Founded in the tumultuous spring of 2020, they were initially moved to investigate ways in which intimacy could be shared with an audience during a time of profound seclusion. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The inquisitive nature of this creative process led them to fuse their organic acrobatic research with elements of physical theatre and nuanced choreographic work. By providing the awe-inspiring qualities of contemporary circus with a scaffolding of depth and context, People Watching began to establish a body of work that is intimate and inherently human.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Using live performance, film, and photography as a vehicle for their artistic endeavors, they have found local and international recognition, which in turn has fostered collaborations with a multitude of established creatives and companies. Additionally, the collective continues to facilitate workshops while touring, allowing them to foster a cultural exchange with fellow artists and share some of the physical language and performance methods they have developed in the creation of their personal work. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Not only did the six Montreal artists from People Watching give us the festival's favorite show, but they also created one of the most remarkable contemporary circus shows in recent years.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“The fact remains that this collective takes us elsewhere.

He has over a dozen albums to his credit, including the acclaimed Bird Calls, which topped many critics’ best-of-year lists for 2015 and was hailed by PopMatters as “complex, rhythmically vital, free in spirit while still criss-crossed with mutating structures.” His album Hero Trio was considered to be one of the best jazz albums of 2020 by critics and fans alike.  Rudresh has been named alto saxophonist of the year for nine of the last eleven years running in Downbeat Magazine’s International Critics’ Polls (2011-2013, 2015-2018, 2020-1), and for five consecutive years by the Jazz Journalists’ Association (2009-2013) and again in 2016. He won alto saxophonist of the year in the 2015-2018 & 2020 JazzTimes Magazine Critics’ Polls and was named the Village Voice’s \"Best Jazz Artist\" in 2015.  He has also received the Guggenheim Fellowship and the Doris Duke Performing Artist Award, among other honors, and is currently the Anthony H. P. Lee ’79 Director of Jazz at Princeton University. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"Mahanthappa's trio convincingly puts a distinctive stamp on the eclectic source material, with sparkling cocktails of hooks, groove and solos that unfurl in structures that can be straight and not so straight.\" Jazzwise Magazine (Editor's Choice)<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rudreshm.com/home \">For more information, CLICK HERE</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Saxophonist Darren WIlliams will perform an opening set of original solo compositions.

Called “a raw, vocal explorer,” (Stuart Broomer) Darren has performed with Eugene Chadbourne, Chad van Gaalen, John Oswald, Mats Gustafsson, Han Bennink, and many others. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.darrenwilliams.ca/\">For more information, CLICK HERE</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $50.00</span> ($41.65 + $2.10 CIF + $6.25 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">30 under 30: $36.31</span> ($29.75 + $2.10 CIF + $4.46 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.10 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

Following the overwhelming response to their 2023 collaboration, the legendary duo will once again share the stage for an intimate, stripped-down concert experience that spans generations of beloved country hits.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Fans can expect a night of unforgettable music and storytelling as Clark and Brandt perform their most celebrated songs, trading stories and personal reflections that shaped their remarkable careers. Sharing the spotlight for the entire show, the pair brings undeniable chemistry and heartfelt connection to every note.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Being on tour with Terri Clark has been a highlight of my career; it’s hard to recall the last time I had so much fun,” says Brandt. “When you find a chemistry that is so natural and powerful, you just want more. The fans have spoken—the demand is there—so here we come. I can’t wait to bring Homecoming Tour 2.0 to stages across Canada.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The 34-date coast-to-coast tour kicks off October 17 in Moncton, NB, and includes stops in Brandon, Yorkton, and more. Hometown shows in Medicine Hat, AB (Clark) and Calgary, AB (Brandt) highlight the run, along with back-to-back performances in cities like St. John’s, Peterborough, Red Deer, and Kelowna. The tour wraps up on December 1 in Cranbrook, BC.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Paul and I had been friends for years, but the Homecoming Tour was our first time sharing the stage—and the magic and chemistry were beyond what we imagined,” says Clark. “We thought it might be a one-time thing, and I was genuinely sad when it ended. I’m thrilled we get to do it again, and to go coast to coast with one of Canada’s finest talents.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">ABOUT TERRI CLARK:</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>From paying her dues at Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge in Nashville to holding the honor of being the only Canadian female member of the Grand Ole Opry, Terri Clark continues to build an unforgettable legacy primed for the history books of Country music. The multi-JUNO Award winner boasts over five million albums sold, three RIAA Platinum and two RIAA Gold-certified albums, Canadian Gold, Platinum, Double Platinum and Triple Platinum-certified albums, 13 Top 10 singles including six No.1s in Canada and the U.S., 19 CCMA Awards and multiple ACM and CMA Female Vocalist of the Year award nominations. Clark also hosts the internationally syndicated, CMA and ACM Award nominated radio show, “Country Gold with Terri Clark,” which can be heard on radio stations across the USA and Canada. In 2018, Clark was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and most recently in 2023, she was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame – joining the likes of Joni Mitchell, Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette, Neil Young and Shania Twain in one of Canada’s highest honors. Clark has performed for sold-out audiences in both Canada and the U.S., headlining her own shows and joining George Strait, Toby Keith, Brooks & Dunn and Brad Paisley. In 2022 and 2023, Clark hit the road with Reba McEntire, continuing to captivate audiences as she took command of the iconic stages of Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl and more as she looks forward to another year full of touring across the U.S. and Canada. Terri Clark: Take Two is the next chapter in Clark’s long history of successes and accolades. Released in 2024, the eight-song album from the legendary singer, songwriter and guitar-slinger pairs her with some of the biggest stars in music today—including Kelly Clarkson, Carly Pearce, Ashley McBryde, Lainey Wilson, Ben Rector and Cody Johnson—for a duets project reimagining her iconic, chart-topping hits.

In 2017, Paul Brandt was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and Western Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame. His 1996 debut RIAA certified Gold album ‘Calm Before the Storm’ went on to sell one million albums internationally, propelled by the #1 single and wedding classic “I Do”. Stateside, his #5 and #1 charting songs “My Heart Has A History”, and “I Do” were the first to chart by a male Canadian Country artist on the US Billboard Top 20 since 1976. His 12 career albums have spawned hit singles, multiple Album of the Year awards, gold, platinum, and multi-platinum performances. According to Nielsen BDS in 2020, of the Top 25 Canadian Country songs, 6 were released by Paul Brandt, and his song “My Heart Has a History” is the most played Canadian Country song since the chart began. Paul is also the most played Canadian Country Artist on Country Radio in history (Nielsen BDS). He has had 27 top ten songs at Canadian Radio. His song “For You” (Brandt/Rosen) was selected to promote the 2002 major motion picture We Were Soldiers and was performed by Dave Matthews and Johnny Cash. In 2015, Canadian Independent Music Association celebrated Paul’s reaching “Road Gold Status” as a top headliner and major box office draw in Canada, and his EP “Frontier” was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2016 Juno Awards. The hit single “I’m An Open Road” from that collection is certified Gold.

Following the overwhelming response to their 2023 collaboration, the legendary duo will once again share the stage for an intimate, stripped-down concert experience that spans generations of beloved country hits.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Fans can expect a night of unforgettable music and storytelling as Clark and Brandt perform their most celebrated songs, trading stories and personal reflections that shaped their remarkable careers. Sharing the spotlight for the entire show, the pair brings undeniable chemistry and heartfelt connection to every note.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Being on tour with Terri Clark has been a highlight of my career; it’s hard to recall the last time I had so much fun,” says Brandt. “When you find a chemistry that is so natural and powerful, you just want more. The fans have spoken—the demand is there—so here we come. I can’t wait to bring Homecoming Tour 2.0 to stages across Canada.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The 34-date coast-to-coast tour kicks off October 17 in Moncton, NB, and includes stops in Brandon, Yorkton, and more. Hometown shows in Medicine Hat, AB (Clark) and Calgary, AB (Brandt) highlight the run, along with back-to-back performances in cities like St. John’s, Peterborough, Red Deer, and Kelowna. The tour wraps up on December 1 in Cranbrook, BC.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Paul and I had been friends for years, but the Homecoming Tour was our first time sharing the stage—and the magic and chemistry were beyond what we imagined,” says Clark. “We thought it might be a one-time thing, and I was genuinely sad when it ended. I’m thrilled we get to do it again, and to go coast to coast with one of Canada’s finest talents.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">ABOUT TERRI CLARK:</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>From paying her dues at Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge in Nashville to holding the honor of being the only Canadian female member of the Grand Ole Opry, Terri Clark continues to build an unforgettable legacy primed for the history books of Country music. The multi-JUNO Award winner boasts over five million albums sold, three RIAA Platinum and two RIAA Gold-certified albums, Canadian Gold, Platinum, Double Platinum and Triple Platinum-certified albums, 13 Top 10 singles including six No.1s in Canada and the U.S., 19 CCMA Awards and multiple ACM and CMA Female Vocalist of the Year award nominations. Clark also hosts the internationally syndicated, CMA and ACM Award nominated radio show, “Country Gold with Terri Clark,” which can be heard on radio stations across the USA and Canada. In 2018, Clark was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and most recently in 2023, she was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame – joining the likes of Joni Mitchell, Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette, Neil Young and Shania Twain in one of Canada’s highest honors. Clark has performed for sold-out audiences in both Canada and the U.S., headlining her own shows and joining George Strait, Toby Keith, Brooks & Dunn and Brad Paisley. In 2022 and 2023, Clark hit the road with Reba McEntire, continuing to captivate audiences as she took command of the iconic stages of Madison Square Garden, the Hollywood Bowl and more as she looks forward to another year full of touring across the U.S. and Canada. Terri Clark: Take Two is the next chapter in Clark’s long history of successes and accolades. Released in 2024, the eight-song album from the legendary singer, songwriter and guitar-slinger pairs her with some of the biggest stars in music today—including Kelly Clarkson, Carly Pearce, Ashley McBryde, Lainey Wilson, Ben Rector and Cody Johnson—for a duets project reimagining her iconic, chart-topping hits.

In 2017, Paul Brandt was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and Western Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame. His 1996 debut RIAA certified Gold album ‘Calm Before the Storm’ went on to sell one million albums internationally, propelled by the #1 single and wedding classic “I Do”. Stateside, his #5 and #1 charting songs “My Heart Has A History”, and “I Do” were the first to chart by a male Canadian Country artist on the US Billboard Top 20 since 1976. His 12 career albums have spawned hit singles, multiple Album of the Year awards, gold, platinum, and multi-platinum performances. According to Nielsen BDS in 2020, of the Top 25 Canadian Country songs, 6 were released by Paul Brandt, and his song “My Heart Has a History” is the most played Canadian Country song since the chart began. Paul is also the most played Canadian Country Artist on Country Radio in history (Nielsen BDS). He has had 27 top ten songs at Canadian Radio. His song “For You” (Brandt/Rosen) was selected to promote the 2002 major motion picture We Were Soldiers and was performed by Dave Matthews and Johnny Cash. In 2015, Canadian Independent Music Association celebrated Paul’s reaching “Road Gold Status” as a top headliner and major box office draw in Canada, and his EP “Frontier” was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2016 Juno Awards. The hit single “I’m An Open Road” from that collection is certified Gold. His 2019 Canadian tour “The Journey Tour” featured his most recent radio singles “All About Her” (Top 10 Canadian Country Radio) and “Bittersweet” (featuring Lindsay Ell) continue to speak to Brandt’s enduring impact and influence on country music audiences and industry as he played arenas across Canada. During the 2019 Canadian Country Music Awards, Paul was honoured with the Slaight Music Humanitarian of the Year Award for his accomplishments with his “Not In My City” (www.notinmycity.ca) movement, which seeks to end human trafficking with a focus on preventing childhood sexual exploitation.

They are proud to introduce Andy Mauck as their lead vocalist. Andy is a student of Gord’s craft as well as his personal friend for almost 50 years. He even plays the same guitars that Gord did.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Join the band in concert for an authentic experience of THE SONGS OF GORDON LIGHTFOOT.

	</table><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Strumbellas know that misery loves company, and that if we’re together, even in dark times, there’s some joy in that. Their songs of suffering and celebration date back to their 2012 debut My Father And The Hunter, and the band have obsessively chased big hooks, group vocal exuberance, and folk-rock propulsion through their 2016 breakthrough Hope to 2024’s Part Time Believer. The Juno and iHeartRadio Music Award-winning group’s new song Hard Lines gives listeners an urgent, new take on their iconic mix of intimate feelings with stadium folk sounds.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Determined to use every tool in their arsenal to write a good song, The Strumbellas started by looking inward: random song titles, non-sequitur ideas, scraps of paper, and voice memos of half-sung melodies came from everyone in the band. They then connected with their favourite collaborators, songwriters and producers anywhere from their home in Toronto to Vancouver, Nashville, or LA, to create demos that ranged from campfire-chord whispers to radio-ready productions. The long list was then whittled down by the band along with producer Chad Copelin (LANY, Sasha Sloan, Colony House), who recorded the band at his studio in Norman, Oklahoma.

In 2023 they were inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and Canada's Walk of Fame.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Then, as now, what makes Trooper what they are is great performances and great pop songwriting.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Trooper's ten studio albums have earned multiple gold and platinum awards and their 6 X Platinum greatest hits, Hot Shots, continues to be one of Universal Music Canada's best selling catalog CDs and one of the country's most enduring party soundtracks. In celebration of the band's 35th anniversary, a totally updated and re-mastered collection - \"Hits From 10 Albums\" - was released, featuring songs spanning the entirety of their recording career. John Kereiff, writing in Gonzo Magazine, dubbed the collection \"THE summer album of 2010.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"We're Here for a Good Time (Not a Long Time)\", \"Raise a Little Hell\", \"The Boys in the Bright White Sportscar\", \"Two For the Show\", \"Pretty Lady\" \"Good Ol' General Hand Grenade\", \"Round, Round We Go\", \"Santa Maria\", \"Janine\" - just a few of the Trooper hits that, according to writer Ryan Sparks, \"have woven their way into the fabric of this country like no other bands have been able to do. Tune into any radio station from Vancouver to St John's and you're bound to encounter one of their dozen hit radio anthems that are still featured in heavy rotation to this day.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dan Brisbois of canadianbands.com writes, \"They've won practically every Canadian music award possible and they've been dubbed 'Canada's Greatest Party Band' ... and rightfully so.\" Bob Mersereau, author of The Top 100 Canadian Albums wrote, \"Trooper's Hot Shots has been one of the biggest-selling albums in Canadian music history. It has gone six times platinum, and sells consistently, as do tickets to Trooper gigs. There are shows and festivals across the country where the annual Trooper show is practically an official holiday.\" Indeed, Trooper continues to consistently sell out shows across the country - often performing for three generations of fans - demonstrating that the band and its music remain borderless, timeless, and ageless.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>It's no exaggeration to say that Trooper has become a Canadian legend. They continue to perform their huge collection of hits with the vitality and sense of humor that has served them well on their steady march through the hills and valleys of Canadian Rock and Roll.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular  $99.00</span>  ($87.45 base price + $2.10 CIF + $9.45 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

The film, Trouble in the Headwaters, is a hard-hitting 25-minute documentary by filmmaker Dan Pierce, which examines the disastrous 2018 flood event in Grand Forks, BC and the hydrological connection to clear-cut logging in the Kettle River Watershed.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Pierce’s film features the research of Dr. Younes Alila, a civil engineer and professor of forest hydrology at the UBC Faculty of Forestry, who has studied the connection between forestry and flooding for decades. His groundbreaking peer-reviewed science has exposed how government and industry have wildly underestimated the risk of flooding caused by clearcutting. Pierce and Alila will both be in attendance at all of the screening events on the documentary tour.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The screenings are being hosted by an array of grassroots community groups who are actively engaged in trying to preserve what’s left of their community watersheds and primary forests in their own backyards. Events will be taking place from September 4th–17th in Kelowna, Grand Forks, Nelson, Penticton, Vernon, Prince George and Roberts Creek, with more dates being added throughout the year. (See below for a full list of community screenings.)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“These communities are very aware of the need for good forestry jobs for their families and neighbours,” said the film director, Daniel Pierce, “But they’re also deeply concerned about the heightened risk of flooding, landslides and drought that’s been unleashed upon the landscape. These screenings are an opportunity to weigh the costs and benefits of our logging practices and envision a new paradigm of forest management that protects workers and communities.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In addition to showing the film, Pierce and Alila will be facilitating in-depth discussions to expand upon the themes of the film and delve into local issues. Regional scholars, practitioners and advocates will also take part in the discussions to give each event a local perspective.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Information on all community screenings is listed below, along with links to reserve seats. Get in touch with the host organizations or the film director to schedule a media interview.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information, please contact:<span><br/></span>Daniel J.
