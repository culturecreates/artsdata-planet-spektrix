Few Canadian musicians are as synonymous with their home province as Doyle is to his – and even fewer once worked as tour guides. In “The Smiling Land,” he reprises his tour- guiding role to welcome the rest of Canada to his home and take readers on an adventure: a freewheeling road trip through Newfoundland, its history and its culture.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">ABOUT ALAN DOYLE:</span><span><br/></span>Alan Doyle is a multifaceted singer-songwriter, going on three decades strong as a musician – first as a member of the much-celebrated band Great Big Sea and now as an internationally acclaimed solo artist. His CV is extensive — he is a published author of four books, a film and TV actor-producer with multiple major credits, and star and co-writer of the musical Tell Tale Harbour. Yet the wildly popular musician from Petty Harbour, Newfoundland, remains most electrifying before a live audience, abetted by his ace band. \"I am the luckiest guy in the world,\" Doyle says. \"It's such a privilege to stand among those players on stage.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 1  $107.59</span>  ($91.50 base price + $2.36 CIF + $13.73 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 2  $84.59</span>  ($71.50 base price + $2.36 CIF + $10.73 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.25 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

This season features the captivating work of artists Chloe Jenkins and Cam Gelderman, who invite audiences to explore diverse connections to nature, community, and the beauty found in everyday moments. These two exhibitions, running from October 17, 2025, through February 15, 2026, will transform the lobby into a vibrant space for reflection and discovery.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the <span class=\"BoldText\">Rise</span> exhibition space, Chloe Jenkins presents <span class=\"ItalicText\">A Room with a View</span>, a collection that celebrates the profound beauty of everyday moments and fleeting light. This series focuses on the dramatic instances of illumination we often overlook—sunlight filtering through a windowpane, the soft glow of a streetlamp at dusk, or tranquil room light at night. By capturing these subtle details, Jenkins aims to remind viewers to appreciate life as it happens. The paintings are designed to catch the eye from across the lobby with their high-contrast, often vignetted compositions, while a closer inspection reveals rich, subtle detail.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The <span class=\"BoldText\">Cube</span> exhibition space features Cam Gelderman’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Yarn-finity</span>, a vibrant and ever-growing art project that began its journey in the spring of 2022. This impressive yarn mural stands as a powerful testament to the strength and spirit of community, having been created knot by knot by countless contributors. The core principle behind this collective effort is the belief that each person is unique, and as such, every single knot tied is unrepeatable. The completed mural beautifully depicts the interconnectedness of individuals and symbolizes the tremendous growth that can be achieved when we work together, one small effort at a time. It serves as a living representation of the diverse and creative community we all share.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please join us for a Public Reception on <span class=\"BoldText\">October 22, from 5–7 PM</span>. This is a wonderful opportunity to meet artists Chloe Jenkins and Cam Gelderman, discuss their work, and celebrate the opening of the new season. Refreshments will be served.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\"><span class=\"ItalicText\">A Room with a View</span></span> and <span class=\"BoldText\"><span class=\"ItalicText\">Yarn-finity</span></span> will be on view from <span class=\"BoldText\">October 17, 2025 to February 15, 2026</span>, in the lobby of the Kelowna Community Theatre.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Admission is free of charge, though registration is required.</span><span><br/></span>

Their raw and emotionally-driven movement will bring to life the urgent desire to grasp hold of the present as they explore the paradoxical pull of past and future. This gripping world premiere features an original composition by Ben Waters.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Doppeling</span></h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Choreography: Simone Orlando</span><span><br/></span>Originally created for Ballet BC in 2009 and later remounted by both Ballet BC and Ballet Kelowna, Simone Orlando’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Doppeling</span> has been described by <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Georgia Straight</span> as “a gender-bending vision of doppelganger ballerinas breaking loose.” Set to J.S. Bach’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Double Violin Concerto</span>, the piece features the ensemble clad in identical shimmering gold unitards and sleek bobbed wigs. A mesmerizing commentary on conformity and individuality, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Doppeling</span> is at once playful, serene, and stylishly subversive.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><span class=\"BoldText\">The Cowboy Act Suite</span></h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Choreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe</span><span><br/></span>After its successful 2023 debut, Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Cowboy Act</span> was reimagined for the road as <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Cowboy Act Suite</span>, with refreshed scenes and new surprises for touring audiences. Set to music by Tom Wilson and iskwē, the work includes a life-sized chuckwagon blasting across the stage. A sharp and satirical take on the “Cowboys and Indians” trope, this production reclaims the narrative by putting the Indigenous voice in the director’s chair – challenging whose story gets told, and by whom.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Countermove is part of Ballet Kelowna's 2025/26 Season.<span><br/></span><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theboxoffice.ca/box-office/ballet-kelowna-202526\"> Subscribe here to save up to 15% OFF single ticket prices!</a></h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Subscriptions on sale until November 8, 2025.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ballet Kelowna tickets and their applicable fees are non-refundable.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Section A</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Adult</span> $85.50 base price + $2.10 CIF + $9.45 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$97.05</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Senior</span> $76.21 base price + $2.10 CIF + $9.45 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$87.76</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Student/Child</span> $32.78 base price + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$42.23</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Section B</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Adult</span> $73.43 base price + $2.10 CIF + $9.45 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$84.98</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Senior</span> $65.12 base price + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$75.62</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Student/Child</span> $32.78 base price + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$42.23</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Section C</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Adult</span> $62.73 base price + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$73.23</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Senior</span> $54.40 base price + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$64.90</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Student/Child</span> $32.78 base price + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$42.23</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Accessible seating/Companion</span> $32.78 base price + $2.10 CIF + $7.35 service charge = <span class=\"BoldText\">$42.23</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Senior - age 65+, Student must have valid ID, Child is 12 and under.</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">A service fee is added for box office costs, card processing, and taxes.

Recorded live, it received widespread praise from tastemakers and fans alike. They continued to evolve with their viral singles “I’d Have To Think About It” and “We’ll Never Have Sex,” while also maintaining their momentum with a rising social presence. Signing to Republic Records in 2022 lead to their long awaited debut album To Learn the following year. As with all of their music, the songs on To Learn are deeply personal and take them to vulnerable places, exploring themes like queerness, love, relationships, and mental health and rendered in folk-adjacent tones—sometimes with a pop beat or a rock riff, sometimes with just their voice and their guitar alone. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Closing out 2023, they unveiled the deluxe version To Learn, More, including live versions of fan favorites “(You) On My Arm,” “Orlando,” and “To Learn.” Critical acclaim followed from the likes of NME, CLASH, Them., Ones To Watch, and The FADER, who hailed them as “your new obsession.” Beyond tours with Lord Huron, Bahamas, and Helena Deland, they sold out headline shows worldwide, performed at festivals across North America, and received the inaugural “John Prine Songwriter Fellowship” at 2022’s Newport Folk Festival and a nomination for “Alternative Album of the Year” at 2024’s Juno Awards. Now, with over 450 million streams across their catalogue to date, they return with the new emotionally charged single “Grieving,” heralding a highly anticipated new album helmed by hit producer Rostam (Vampire Weekend).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 1  $60.21</span>  ($50.00 base price + $2.36 CIF + $7.85 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tier 2  $42.96</span>  ($35.00 base price + $2.36 CIF + $5.60 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.36 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

His latest album, The Hammer & The Rose, is a veritable garden of heart; a (mostly) delicate collection of tender folk and stirring soul numbers that find the New Brunswick-born songwriter thoughtfully tending to the most important things in life. Andersen’s stage presence is informed by decades of cutting his teeth in dusty clubs, dim-lit bars, and grand theatres all over the world, delivering moving performances that run the gamut from intimate to wall-shaking. In the studio, he’s always brought the same attention to detail and commitment to craft as he has to his live show, and the result - a multi-faceted and poignant body of work - has led him to amass over 33 million streams on Spotify and 30 million views on YouTube. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In addition to headlining major festivals, clubs and theatres throughout North America, Europe, and Australia, he has shared the stage and toured with Marcus King, Beth Hart, Marty Stuart, Greg Allman, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Randy Bachman, Serena Ryder, Tab Benoit, and more. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Andersen nabbed the 2013 and 2016 European Blues Awards for Best Solo/Acoustic Act, was the first ever Canadian to take home top honours in the solo category at the 2010 International Blues Challenge in Memphis, won the CIMA Road Gold award in 2015, and has won multiple Maple Blues Awards.

Joined by longtime collaborator Laurence Knight (bass/vocals), and a top-tier ensemble including Adam Rohrlick (guitar/keys), Jerry Cook (sax/flute), Geeta Das (trumpet), and Greg Stuart (drums/vocals) - they bring Van’s Celtic-inspired blend of blues, jazz, folk, and soul to life. This show will have you singing along and shutting your eyes to truly make you think that the legendary Hall of Famer Van Morrison is in the room with you.

This show, fueled by Coughlan’s award-winning interpretive skill and the band’s dynamic energy, promises a night of unforgettable music.

The two artists met and lived together in NYC and later Montreal, sharing life and art until the death of Douglas from AIDS in 1996. The culmination of this artistic relationship, “While Waiting” – choreographed by Douglas and performed by Navas – was recognized in 1994 with a Bessie Award (New York Dance and Performance Award). <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The choreographer–soloist will perform on a simple open stage, set with three chairs. There will be movement in the space to the music of Bach, PJ Harvey, Billie Holliday, and Dorothy Moore. He renews his longstanding collaborations with light designer Marc Parent and costume designer Sonya Bayer. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>AVES is a luminous dance ritual of hope and optimism, Navas’ way to pay homage to Douglas. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">José Navas</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A native of Caracas, Venezuela, José Navas moved to New York before settling in Montreal, where he created his first choreography in 1991. Four years later he founded Compagnie Flak. José Navas dances with intensity in solo shows charged with emotion, he constructs abstract and captivating group pieces, and he creates pieces of contemporary ballet with classicism and sensitivity. As guest choreographer for prestigious ballet companies, he created an iconoclastic version of Giselle (2013) for Ballet BC, Watershed (2013) for the National Ballet of Canada, and Dénouement/Auflösung (2015) for the German company tanzmainz. His work has been presented in 30 countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://flak.org/jose-navas/en/repertoire/aves-en/\">For more information on Jose, click here</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $45.00</span> ($37.08 + $2.36 CIF + $5.56 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">30 under 30: $32.82</span> ($26.49 + $2.36 CIF + $3.97 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.36 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

Blending Bharata Natyam, global music, and contemporary movement, the piece is inspired by The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho and shaped by themes of migration, identity, and transformation.

Those partnerships have taught him how to unmake a tune—picking up someone else’s idea and finding new ways to fill it in. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>With his new album Falcon's Heart, he drew his inspiration from classic country songwriting.

Ben-Shalom’s first solo album, Known and Unknown, is set to be released in spring 2025. Ben-Shalom translates from Hebrew as “son of peace.” A desire to build connection and community is at the heart of the project. Known and Unknown may be the most meaningful and heartfelt work of his career to date. A bold, avant-folk record drenched in Jewish tradition and ripe for this current moment in a world longing to feel connected. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ben-Shalom has released seven albums with various ensembles, been nominated for a JUNO Award, won a Western Canadian Music Award, and performed on stages across North America. His work has been featured by broadcasters across much of the English-speaking world. Along the way he’s collaborated with Canadian icons, having sung a duet with Bif Naked and played banjo with Tegan and Sara. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ben-Shalom is part of a movement of contemporary Jewish artists strengthening their community and building bridges of shared humanity with a wider audience. Ben-Shalom understands the desire to probe the deepest mysteries and to search for meaning in our lives as a universal human experience. Ben-Shalom views his music as an act of engaging with the oral tradition of his ancestors. His songs place him in a lineage of storytelling that stretches back to the beginnings of shared human thought. Diving into this rich tradition has had a profound impact on Ben-Shalom. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $40.00</span> ($32.73 + $2.36 CIF + $4.91 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">30 under 30: $29.25</span> ($23.38 + $2.36 CIF + $3.51 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre at the Rotary Centre for the Arts event tickets include a $2.36 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF).

Through its dynamic hybrid of acrobatics, movement and physical theatre, the piece puts forth a surrealist chronicle of the familiar. But far from settling into bored fatalism, this show marvels at the absurdity of the mundane and celebrates life, the same way people desperately dance to the last song before the party ends. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>People Watching is a collective comprising six multidisciplinary artists currently based in Montreal. Each personally established in their field, they have worked for companies such as The 7 Fingers, Circa, Cirque du Soleil and Jacob Jonas the Company. Founded in the tumultuous spring of 2020, they were initially moved to investigate ways in which intimacy could be shared with an audience during a time of profound seclusion. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The inquisitive nature of this creative process led them to fuse their organic acrobatic research with elements of physical theatre and nuanced choreographic work. By providing the awe-inspiring qualities of contemporary circus with a scaffolding of depth and context, People Watching began to establish a body of work that is intimate and inherently human.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Using live performance, film, and photography as a vehicle for their artistic endeavors, they have found local and international recognition, which in turn has fostered collaborations with a multitude of established creatives and companies.

Jon Washburn founded the choir in 1971 and it has become an amazing success story, ranking with the handful of North America’s best professional choruses and noted for its diverse repertoire and performing excellence. The choir has presented concerts to audiences at home in Vancouver and on tour across Canada. International excursions have taken them to the USA, Mexico, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Finland, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Honoured with the Margaret Hillis Award for Choral Excellence by Chorus America, the choir has performed countless concerts and broadcasts, released 36 recordings and received numerous awards. Foremost supporters of Canadian music, they are responsible for commissions and premieres of 334 choral works by 145 composers and arrangers, most of whom are Canadian. Over the years the choir has sung over 4,000 performances of works by Canadian composers, in addition to their extensive international repertoire.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Program</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Vancouver Chamber Choir</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kari Turunen, conductor</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">TRUE NORTH</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Zumak</span> (2024)  ---  Russell Wallace (b. 1951)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Sügismaastikud</span> (1964) [<span class=\"ItalicText\">Text by Viivi Luik</span>]  ---  Veljo Tormis (1930-2017)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Crooked by Nature</span> (2020) [<span class=\"ItalicText\">Various</span>]  ---  Carmen Braden (b. 1985)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Girl Hours</span> (2019) [<span class=\"ItalicText\">Text by Sofia Samatar</span>]  ---  Stuart Beatch (b. 1991)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regn og Rusk og Rosenbusk</span> (1991) [<span class=\"ItalicText\">Text by H.C.

Following the overwhelming response to their 2023 collaboration, the legendary duo will once again share the stage for an intimate, stripped-down concert experience that spans generations of beloved country hits.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Fans can expect a night of unforgettable music and storytelling as Clark and Brandt perform their most celebrated songs, trading stories and personal reflections that shaped their remarkable careers.

Clark also hosts the internationally syndicated, CMA and ACM Award nominated radio show, “Country Gold with Terri Clark,” which can be heard on radio stations across the USA and Canada. In 2018, Clark was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and most recently in 2023, she was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame – joining the likes of Joni Mitchell, Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette, Neil Young and Shania Twain in one of Canada’s highest honors. Clark has performed for sold-out audiences in both Canada and the U.S., headlining her own shows and joining George Strait, Toby Keith, Brooks & Dunn and Brad Paisley.

Released in 2024, the eight-song album from the legendary singer, songwriter and guitar-slinger pairs her with some of the biggest stars in music today—including Kelly Clarkson, Carly Pearce, Ashley McBryde, Lainey Wilson, Ben Rector and Cody Johnson—for a duets project reimagining her iconic, chart-topping hits.

In 2017, Paul Brandt was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame and Western Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame. His 1996 debut RIAA certified Gold album ‘Calm Before the Storm’ went on to sell one million albums internationally, propelled by the #1 single and wedding classic “I Do”. Stateside, his #5 and #1 charting songs “My Heart Has A History”, and “I Do” were the first to chart by a male Canadian Country artist on the US Billboard Top 20 since 1976. His 12 career albums have spawned hit singles, multiple Album of the Year awards, gold, platinum, and multi-platinum performances. According to Nielsen BDS in 2020, of the Top 25 Canadian Country songs, 6 were released by Paul Brandt, and his song “My Heart Has a History” is the most played Canadian Country song since the chart began. Paul is also the most played Canadian Country Artist on Country Radio in history (Nielsen BDS). He has had 27 top ten songs at Canadian Radio. His song “For You” (Brandt/Rosen) was selected to promote the 2002 major motion picture We Were Soldiers and was performed by Dave Matthews and Johnny Cash. In 2015, Canadian Independent Music Association celebrated Paul’s reaching “Road Gold Status” as a top headliner and major box office draw in Canada, and his EP “Frontier” was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2016 Juno Awards. The hit single “I’m An Open Road” from that collection is certified Gold. His 2019 Canadian tour “The Journey Tour” featured his most recent radio singles “All About Her” (Top 10 Canadian Country Radio) and “Bittersweet” (featuring Lindsay Ell) continue to speak to Brandt’s enduring impact and influence on country music audiences and industry as he played arenas across Canada. During the 2019 Canadian Country Music Awards, Paul was honoured with the Slaight Music Humanitarian of the Year Award for his accomplishments with his “Not In My City” (www.notinmycity.ca) movement, which seeks to end human trafficking with a focus on preventing childhood sexual exploitation. Paul lives with his wife Liz and their two children on The Buckspring Ranch in the foothills of Alberta’s Rocky Mountains.

	</table><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Strumbellas know that misery loves company, and that if we’re together, even in dark times, there’s some joy in that. Their songs of suffering and celebration date back to their 2012 debut My Father And The Hunter, and the band have obsessively chased big hooks, group vocal exuberance, and folk-rock propulsion through their 2016 breakthrough Hope to 2024’s Part Time Believer. The Juno and iHeartRadio Music Award-winning group’s new song Hard Lines gives listeners an urgent, new take on their iconic mix of intimate feelings with stadium folk sounds.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Determined to use every tool in their arsenal to write a good song, The Strumbellas started by looking inward: random song titles, non-sequitur ideas, scraps of paper, and voice memos of half-sung melodies came from everyone in the band. They then connected with their favourite collaborators, songwriters and producers anywhere from their home in Toronto to Vancouver, Nashville, or LA, to create demos that ranged from campfire-chord whispers to radio-ready productions. The long list was then whittled down by the band along with producer Chad Copelin (LANY, Sasha Sloan, Colony House), who recorded the band at his studio in Norman, Oklahoma. Copelin’s finely honed sonic instincts bring out a newly textured, insistently edgy side to The Strumbellas’ alt-folk stomp.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“We’re living in a lonely world,” says keyboardist Dave Ritter. “Whether it’s work or our home life or our screens, life seems cut up into smaller and smaller pieces all disconnected from each other. Hard Lines is about picking your way through the rubble of contemporary life and the hope that we can build things together again. It’s something we’re reminded of when we gather to write or rehearse songs, and when we get to play for people, that music brings us together, gives us some moments of connection that are hard to find these days.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Extremely limited VIP add-ons available at checkout!</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">P1: $59.40</span> ($49.50 base price + $2.10 CIF + $7.80 service charge)<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">P2: $49.40</span> ($39.50 base price + $2.10 CIF + $6.23 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>All above prices are in CAD and include GST.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

Universal Music acknowledges them as \"one of Canada's top five selling bands of all time\" and the Vancouver Sun has called them \"Canadian rock heroes of the first order ... the best performing band in Canada\". In 2023 they were inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and Canada's Walk of Fame.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Then, as now, what makes Trooper what they are is great performances and great pop songwriting.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Trooper's ten studio albums have earned multiple gold and platinum awards and their 6 X Platinum greatest hits, Hot Shots, continues to be one of Universal Music Canada's best selling catalog CDs and one of the country's most enduring party soundtracks. In celebration of the band's 35th anniversary, a totally updated and re-mastered collection - \"Hits From 10 Albums\" - was released, featuring songs spanning the entirety of their recording career. John Kereiff, writing in Gonzo Magazine, dubbed the collection \"THE summer album of 2010.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"We're Here for a Good Time (Not a Long Time)\", \"Raise a Little Hell\", \"The Boys in the Bright White Sportscar\", \"Two For the Show\", \"Pretty Lady\" \"Good Ol' General Hand Grenade\", \"Round, Round We Go\", \"Santa Maria\", \"Janine\" - just a few of the Trooper hits that, according to writer Ryan Sparks, \"have woven their way into the fabric of this country like no other bands have been able to do. Tune into any radio station from Vancouver to St John's and you're bound to encounter one of their dozen hit radio anthems that are still featured in heavy rotation to this day.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dan Brisbois of canadianbands.com writes, \"They've won practically every Canadian music award possible and they've been dubbed 'Canada's Greatest Party Band' ... and rightfully so.\" Bob Mersereau, author of The Top 100 Canadian Albums wrote, \"Trooper's Hot Shots has been one of the biggest-selling albums in Canadian music history. It has gone six times platinum, and sells consistently, as do tickets to Trooper gigs. There are shows and festivals across the country where the annual Trooper show is practically an official holiday.\" Indeed, Trooper continues to consistently sell out shows across the country - often performing for three generations of fans - demonstrating that the band and its music remain borderless, timeless, and ageless.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>It's no exaggeration to say that Trooper has become a Canadian legend. They continue to perform their huge collection of hits with the vitality and sense of humor that has served them well on their steady march through the hills and valleys of Canadian Rock and Roll.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular  $99.00</span>  ($87.45 base price + $2.10 CIF + $9.45 service charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices are in CAD and include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

The film, Trouble in the Headwaters, is a hard-hitting 25-minute documentary by filmmaker Dan Pierce, which examines the disastrous 2018 flood event in Grand Forks, BC and the hydrological connection to clear-cut logging in the Kettle River Watershed.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Pierce’s film features the research of Dr. Younes Alila, a civil engineer and professor of forest hydrology at the UBC Faculty of Forestry, who has studied the connection between forestry and flooding for decades. His groundbreaking peer-reviewed science has exposed how government and industry have wildly underestimated the risk of flooding caused by clearcutting. Pierce and Alila will both be in attendance at all of the screening events on the documentary tour.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The screenings are being hosted by an array of grassroots community groups who are actively engaged in trying to preserve what’s left of their community watersheds and primary forests in their own backyards. Events will be taking place from September 4th–17th in Kelowna, Grand Forks, Nelson, Penticton, Vernon, Prince George and Roberts Creek, with more dates being added throughout the year. (See below for a full list of community screenings.)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“These communities are very aware of the need for good forestry jobs for their families and neighbours,” said the film director, Daniel Pierce, “But they’re also deeply concerned about the heightened risk of flooding, landslides and drought that’s been unleashed upon the landscape. These screenings are an opportunity to weigh the costs and benefits of our logging practices and envision a new paradigm of forest management that protects workers and communities.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In addition to showing the film, Pierce and Alila will be facilitating in-depth discussions to expand upon the themes of the film and delve into local issues. Regional scholars, practitioners and advocates will also take part in the discussions to give each event a local perspective.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Information on all community screenings is listed below, along with links to reserve seats. Get in touch with the host organizations or the film director to schedule a media interview.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information, please contact:<span><br/></span>Daniel J.
