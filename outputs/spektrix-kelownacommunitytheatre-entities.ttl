His remarkable journey has seen him embrace folk, jazz, rock, and worldbeat styles while travelling to such far-flung places as Guatemala, Mali, Mozambique, and Nepal, and writing memorable songs about his ever-expanding world of wonders. “My job,” he explains, “is to try and trap the spirit of things in the scratches of pen on paper and the pulling of notes out of metal.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>That scratching and pulling has earned Cockburn high praise as an exceptional songwriter and a revered guitarist. His songs of romance, protest, and spiritual discovery are among the best to have emerged from Canada over the last 50 years. His guitar playing, both acoustic and electric, has placed him in the company of the world’s top instrumentalists. And he remains deeply respected for his activism on issues from native rights and land mines to the environment and Third World debt, working for organizations such as Oxfam, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, and Friends of the Earth. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Throughout his career, Cockburn has deftly captured the joy, pain, fear, and faith<span><br/></span>of human experience in song. Whether singing about retreating to the country or going up against chaos, tackling imperialist lies or embracing ecclesiastical truths, he has always expressed a tough yet hopeful stance: to kick at the darkness till it bleeds daylight. “We can’t settle for things as they are,” he once warned. “If you don’t tackle the problems, they’re going to get worse.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For his many achievements, the Ottawa-born artist has been honoured with 13 Juno Awards, an induction into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, as well as the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award, and has been made an Officer of the Order of Canada. But he never rests on his laurels. “I’d rather think about what I’m going to do next,” says Cockburn. “My models for graceful aging are guys like John Lee Hooker and Mississippi John Hurt, who never stop working till they drop, as I fully expect to be doing, and just getting better as musicians and as human beings.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>His commitment to growth has made Bruce Cockburn both an exemplary citizen and a legendary artist whose prized songbook will be celebrated for many years to come.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $79.50</span> ($69.00 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

The band set the bar in 1986, and they’ve remained the industry leading substitute for The Eagles ever since. Playing to huge outdoor and arena audiences, sharing bills with some of rock’s legends, and going places no tribute band has gone before. A long run by any measure, but it begs the question - what makes HOTEL CALIFORNIA so special? Well, incredible lead vocal similarity, intensely accurate instrumental work, soaring harmonies, and top-flight live performances, just for starters. These are the band’s hallmarks, and the foundation on which their reputation has been built. With over a century of collective professional experience in the band today, they’re still going stronger than ever!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>HOTEL CALIFORNIA’s show has evolved into a masterful celebration of The Eagles’ music. One of the most game-changing song catalogs in the history of rock n’ roll is performed to perfection before your eyes and ears. The band also offers tons of value-added promotional support and materials to every client, and the confidence that industry insiders have in them has made HOTEL CALIFORNIA one of the world’s most accomplished tribute productions. You can check them out any time you like, but you’ll never want to leave.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>If you love The Eagles, then welcome to the Hotel California – you’ve just found the next-best thing.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $60.00</span> ($49.50 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Ticketing Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

At six, after his parents divorced and he moved to Toronto with his mother, the prodigy attended the prestigious Eli Kassner Guitar Academy. During summers with his father in Arles in France, he soaked up more flamenco from neighbour Nicolas Reyes, leader of the world-renowned Gipsy Kings.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>After attending the Royal Conservatory, York University and Berklee College, a comfortable career as a composer seemed in the cards — until an Ontario cable TV company aired his music on the listings channel. “Their switchboard got flooded with calls,” he recalls. “People even got my number somehow and started phoning me at home and asking for a CD. And I was saying, ‘I don’t have a CD, I’m a background composer guy. I don’t make records.’ <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Seeing opportunity, Cook self-produced Tempest at home using an eight-track recorder and one microphone. Then he delivered the initial run of 1,000 CDs from the plant to the distributor in his car. Those humble beginnings quickly sparked a mighty international career, including an extensive discography of 14 albums so far.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“It turns out I did the thing I said I’d never do, and somehow it worked out. In the U.S., it was a breakthrough gig at the Catalina Jazz Festival, where his playing earned a 10-minute standing ovation, sparked mob scenes — “It was like being The Beatles,” he marvels — and prompted one store to order enough copies of Tempest to land it at No.14 in Billboard.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In Poland, his 2004 live album Montreal took the country by storm. In India, he gained fame after one of his songs was plagiarized for a major Bollywood movie. (“In India, that’s allowed,” he explains. “They call it cultural appropriation — it obviously doesn’t mean the same thing there.”) In Iraq, his instrumentals scored the nightly news.  Elsewhere, they’ve accompanied gymnastics and skating routines at the Winter Olympics. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“In Torino, both the Japanese and the Russian skater competed using the same song. One of them won. I think I should have got bronze,” he jokes. No wonder Cook also quips that his music “has had a way more interesting life” than he’s had.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Lately, that international appeal — reflected in a compositional style that mixes Flamenco with everything from Classical and Jazz to Zydeco, Blues and Brazilian samba — has become something he takes more seriously. “I’ve just always made the music that I love. But if music can come from around the world and interconnect so beautifully to create this beautiful tapestry, maybe there’s something that music can teach us.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Many of Jesse’s records have charted top 10 on the US Billboard Charts. Over the past three decades, thousands of concerts have been performed in dozens of counties. Some diehard fans have seen 20 or more shows.  That fanbase has scaled exponentially with the digital reach his music and content now enjoy.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Suddenly, homebound in 2020, due to the pandemic, Cook doubled down creating content for social media. Connecting with his fans and creating a new YouTube series that amassed 2 Million views a month. A notable accomplishment during this time was the Love in the time of Covid video project.  Jesse created one music video a week often playing all the instruments. The 31 videos of the series have amassed over 35 million views to date.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Sleeves ever rolled up, Cook worked tirelessly with his team to relaunch the “Tempest” Tour when live audiences became possible again in 2022. He performed over 80 shows with 80% attendance rate - well above the industry standard.  More than 100,000 tickets were sold and a five-page article in Guitar Player Magazine reflected this widening appeal.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2023, Jesse’s Libre Tour visited 85 markets.  Jesse was invited to participate in Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Festival of renowned guitarists in Sept 2023. Jesse’s Instagram reels have become viral, with his audience continuing to grow at an exponential rate. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2024 and 2025, the “Jesse Cook Live in Concert” Tour will continue to expand with his growing popularity and the addition of new cities and larger venues.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“What do I call my music? I never know how to answer that question. Mostly I don’t care, as long as it touches people’s hearts” - Jesse Cook<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Pricing</span></h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $65.50</span> ($55.00 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Ticketing Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

Drawing inspiration from a random selection of tarot cards, the artists explore archetypes through sound and movement, bringing them to life, and exploring their depth and interconnectedness. By incorporating structured improvisation and aleatoric elements into the performance, Rivest and McCloskey create an intimate, dynamic experience, positioning the audience as witness. Vocal timbre contrasts with gestural weight and tension; spatial positioning evokes relationships of complicity and power while retaining a degree of abstraction.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>22 ROOMS is an interdisciplinary exploration where sound and gesture intersect, overlap and interpenetrate, accumulating meaning without developing a narrative – a sensual, ephemeral immersion in sound and movement art. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Jessie Rivest</span> is Vocalist and composer who creates sound art inspired by contemporary a cappella and experimental, interdisciplinary forms.

Notable choral performances include Legends of Zelda at the Sony Centre, Game of Thrones: Music is Coming at the Air Canada Centre, the Canadian premiere of Ēriks Ešenvalds’ Nordic Light Symphony, and the Queen Elizabeth II Commonwealth Tour. Her compositions have been performed by Pro Coro Canada, The Choral Arts Initiative, Khorikos, NEO Voice Festival, and Maureen Batt on the Crossing Borders Tour in Colombia.

Live accompaniment from fiddle and foot percussion oscillates between sound effects and traditional tunes; the music is an integral part of the dramaturgy.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"The image is an object that exists in itself, that touches the inexpressible and that cannot be described without distorting it. The image is an object of thought, dream and criticism. It is a free and autonomous object. It is alive. - Patrick Bonté -<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">SYNOPSIS</span><span><br/></span>Kindred Widows paints a dreamlike portrait of a family that is both terrifying and banal. Through the story of Amanda, who was mute during the last 18 years of her life, this work examines how memory is passed along between women of different generations. Drifting between reality and imagination, the dining room table serves as a theatre where the past resurfaces. As the violin plays, fragments of life, loaded with secrets, flow into each other, and overlap with everyday gestures. An invitation to step into the elusive world of memory.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">CREDITS</span><span><br/></span><ul><li>Creation, design and performance: Claudine Rivest</li><li>Stage direction: Sophie Deslauriers, Claudine Rivest</li><li>Music: Isaac Beaudet Lefebvre</li><li>Lighting design: Nancy Longchamp</li><li>Collaboration on the design of animated costumes: Sylvie Baillargeon</li><li>Collaboration on the design of the scenography: Paul Foresto</li><li>Assistance with puppet design: Sophie Deslauriers</li><li>Advisor on hand puppet manipulation: Noë Cropsal</li><li>Advisor on dramaturgical movement: Olivia Faye Lathuillière</li><li>Co-production: Les Sages Fous</li><li>Special thanks to Les Sages Fous, Maison de la culture Marie-Uguay, La Bulle - lieu de création, Atelier Silex, Dinaïg Stall, Isabelle Payant and Nicole Mossoux.</li></ul><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Claudine Rivest would like to thank the Canada Council for the Arts, Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec as part of the Mauricie partnership program, Les Sages Fous, Maison de la culture Marie-Uguay, La Bulle - lieu de création,  Atelier Silex, Casteliers, Isabelle Payant and Dinaïg Stall.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">DURATION 50 minutes / General audience, 16 years+</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Living Things shows begin promptly at the time printed on the ticket; due to the nature of this performance, no latecomers admitted.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/848504808\">Kindred Widows Teaser Video</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2>Pay What You Wish: available in increments of $10 starting at $25.00 per ticket, plus $2.10 Capital Improvement Fee and $3.00 Service Fee<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Mary Irwin Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

Modern classics by Murail, Glass, and Vivier are staples of the ensemble’s repertoire, along with commissioned works by pioneering Canadian composers such as Nicole Lizee, Jocelyn Morlock, Bekah Simms Giorgio Magnanensi, and Jordan Nobles. This evening's repertoire is selected especially for Kelowna audiences and includes contemporary works that are simultaneously innovative and accessible. Audiences will experience completely original compositions, as well as some that remake works by Claude Debussy and Olivier Messiaen.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In its 30-year history, Standing Wave has commissioned and premiered well over 100 works. The ensemble presents an annual season of concerts in Vancouver, has toured across Canada, and has collaborated with luminary artists such as Kokoro Dance, Ballet BC, Mina Shum, Peter Anderson, Talking Pictures, Veda Hille, and the Git Hayetsk Dancers. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Standing Wave’s latest album, 20C Remix (2021), received a Juno nomination for Classical Album of the Year (small ensemble). Standing Wave was named Artist/Ensemble of the Year at the West Coast Music Awards in 2017 and 2022. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Celebrated on stages across Canada, Standing Wave has been featured as part of the PuSh International Performing Arts Festival, the Modulus Festival, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra New Music Festival, the Victoria Symphony’s New Currents Festival, the Vancouver International Jazz Festival, the Montreal New Music Festival, and Ottawa’s Chamberfest. In 2022 the ensemble performed on Winnipeg’s venerable Groundswell Concert Series as well as New Music Concerts in Toronto. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dedicated to fostering the next generations of Canadian composers, Standing Wave created Compocon in 2019. Compocon is a summer intensive for composition students. Mentor composers join ensemble members during this week-long program that culminates in the development of new works by the students for Standing Wave’s ‘Pierrot + Percussion” instrumentation.

	</table><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Howard and David continue to prove that the trail they’ve ridden to fame has been as unique as their music itself—music that is now celebrating 40 years of success. The road that started on the pop music charts in the ‘70’s, took a winding turn into country music in the ‘80’s, paving the way for duos to come, such as Brooks & Dunn, Montgomery Gentry, Big & Rich, and previously—The Judds. But before the road forked into country, the musical odyssey of brothers Bellamy started creatively smoldering in their home state of Florida, before exploding nationally amidst the ’70’s pop music culture of L.A.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The brothers first official gig was in 1968, playing a free show with their father at the Rattlesnake Roundup in San Antonio, Florida. They honed their early skills playing black clubs throughout the south, and singing backup for artists such as Percy Sledge, Eddie Floyd, and Little Anthony & The Imperials. Within a few months, the brothers moved north, immersing themselves and their rock/country sound in the Atlanta market, where the Allman Brothers were the emerging kings of the music world. With the dawning of the Age of Aquarius on the horizon, and America embroiled in a smoke haze of drugs, civil unrest and an unpopular war, The Bellamy's music picked-up the hard driving edge that bespoke the times. Songwriting had become David Bellamy’s drug of choice during the long road gigs he and Howard were regularly pulling bodies and equipment to and from. It was his songwriting that was posed to soon provide the duo a national breakout.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The break came in the form of the hit, “Spiders & Snakes,” written by David and recorded by Jim Stafford. The song became a smash, eventually selling more than three million units worldwide. It became the catapult that rocketed the brother onto the L.A. music scene. Young and impressionable, Howard and David fell into the musical circle of the greats of the day: Bob Dylan, James Taylor, and Van Morrison, as well as West Coast based country rockers like Poco and the Byrds. It was a creative shoe that fit.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Now known by their music and the company they were keeping, The Bellamys officially lifted off the launch pad in 1976 when their single, “Let Your Love Flow,” became an instant smash in both the U.S. and Europe. It stayed on the international charts long enough to build a huge international fan base for the hip young brothers that endures to this day. In Germany alone it perched at #1 for more than two months. The love was indeed flowing as The Bellamys jammed for audiences on their sold-out concerts and shared stages with the likes of Loggins & Messina, the Doobie Brothers, and the Beach Boys., with their patented blend of rock/country music.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>True to their musical roots, their style and their songwriting was moving steadily more towards their raising. By the late ‘70’s The Bellamys were emerging on the country charts with another bona fide smash. “If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body (Would You Hold It Against Me),” originally scrawled on a dinner napkin by David, rocketed them to the top of the country charts the way “Let Your Love Flow,” had done in the pop market just a few years earlier. It proved to be the first of a string of fourteen #1 singles in the U.S. alone. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Success followed success: “Dancing Cowboys,” “Sugar Daddy,” “You Ain’t Just Whistlin’ Dixie,” “Lovers Live Longer,” “Do You Love As Good As You Look,” “Redneck Girl,” “For All The Wrong Reasons,” “I Love Her Mind,” “I Need More Of You,” “Old Hippie,” “Too Much Is Not Enough,” “Kids Of The Baby Boom,” and “Reggae Cowboy” and “Crazy From The Heart,”…all have lined the corridors of the Bellamy’s musical history and their walls with platinum and gold.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Along the way, Howard and David created a patent on the newly cool “duo” category in country music. In the era of the 2000’s, The Bellamy Brothers hold the record in both the Academy of Country Music (ACM) and the Country Music Association Awards (CMA) for the most duo nominations. Numerous Grammy nods have also been directed toward the brothers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Internationally, the story has been the same—though the titles may be different. The Bellamys have released more than two-dozen hit songs outside the U.S. that were never released here. With a sharp eye on the songwriting skills that have been the bedrock of their success, Howard and David concur that their career is unique in their international finesse for matching their songs to the market.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“For the international releases, you have to have a strong melody,” notes David. “The lyric is very important, but internationally the melody is something fans can lock into, even if they can’t understand the lyrics.” Howard and David continue to perform and film TV specials in Europe and around the world. These days when the subject turns to touring, The Bellamys are showing a new generation of country music how it’s done. “We’re old road dogs,” grins Howard when asked about the motivation behind the brothers 200 plus concert dates each year. Adds David: “Our live draw is bigger than it was in the ‘80’s. I think the same people that grew up with us and with our music in the ‘60’s and ‘70’s obviously have raised a whole new generation of Bellamy fans who started toddling to our music. Now they’re turning up at our concerts as college kids, who are really turned on and tuned in to us and our music….it’s a great feeling.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On the infrequent off days from the road, Howard and David head the bus back to their 150-acre family ranch in Darby, Florida just north of Tampa. A working ranch, the spread consists of Purebred Charlois cattle and quarter horses. Amid a land lush with fruit trees, ancient oaks and crepe myrtles, three generation of the Bellamy family, headed by David and Howard’s mother, Frances, populate the homes clustered in the family compound.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Bellamy Brothers latest project is their new album titled '40 Years' is an ambitious project that celebrates their career with 20 of their biggest hits and then adds 20 brand new songs in this 2 CD anniversary collection.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $74.50</span> ($64.00 + 2.10 CIF + $8.40 Service Charge)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.

A quick look at Canada's music scene from 1971 until 1976 confirms The Stampeders were truly the country's international musical ambassadors, touring more extensively in Canada and overseas than any other Canadian group during that time.  In 1977 the trio: Rich Dodson (lead guitar), Kim Berly (drums) and Ronnie King (bass) parted company but reunited, fittingly at the Calgary Stampede, 15 years later in 1992. Since then, they’ve been recognized by SOCAN for their Lifetime Achievement, been inducted into the SOCAN Songwriters Hall of Fame on five occasions and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame for their 1971 seminal hit Sweet City Woman.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>In March 2024, just before the Ontario leg of this tour, Ronnie King passed away.  In the final days, while in palliative care, he insisted that his band mates carry on.

There was only one answer he could imagine. \"Nobody\". Testing his hypothesis, Stone polled friends, family and fellow musicians how they felt about Petty. The result was always the same. Everybody loves Tom Petty.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>One of these fellow musicians just happened to be Tom Petty's doppelganger, guitarist and lead vocalist Jonathan Guthrie. Guthrie was an avid fan and had always fantasized about being a Heartbreaker. As two seasoned musicians and Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers fans, there was really only one thing for them to do - form a Tom Petty tribute band.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>It wasn't hard for Stone and Guthrie to find skilled musicians excited about playing in a Tom Petty tribute band. Drummer Steve Lucas, formerly of Feverdog and a bandmate of Stone's local band, Theatrix, quickly signed on. Lucas brought with him his M-80's band mate Glenn Freeman. Freeman, who boasts of seeing multiple Tom Petty concerts in the 80's, brought an instrumental cornucopia to the group with keyboards, harmonica, guitar and backing vocals. Lead guitarist Curt Granger rounded out the lineup. With 30+ years experience in Birmingham's local music scene, Granger has played in such circuit bands as Pyrate, Scream Sophie, and his own solo project, as well as creating a line of world-renowned boutique guitar amplifiers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The new Tom Petty tribute band rehearsed with one focus - to recreate the music of Tom Petty with precision, attention to detail, and a reverent respect. Parts were studied in great detail, down to inflections in the very way each word of every lyric was sung.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Performing locally in the first year, it didn't take long for the band to be noticed. Word spread quickly, which led to more shows outside the band's home state, which led to more word of mouth and exposure. Soon the band was gaining interest from venues across the southeast, which led to more travel and more Tom Petty fans discovering them.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Jump ahead 100 shows and The Wildflowers have become one of the most popular tribute shows across the southeast US, and quickly gaining recognition in other regions.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Equipped with decades of experience and a passion for Tom Petty's magic way with songs, The Wildflowers bring music lovers of all stripes what they adore.

	</table><span><br/></span>Anytime you talk to any of Tommy Emmanuel's fans, whether musicians or civilians, invariably they will speak of not one but two qualities that define his greatness. The first, predictably, is his extraordinary guitar playing. Considered by those in the know to be among this planet's greatest guitarists, his playing is simply miraculous, as it would take three musicians, or more, to do what Tommy does solo. Who else, for example, when playing \"Day Tripper,\" can lay down the rhythm part, dig into the riff and sing the melody all at once on just one acoustic guitar? The exuberance Tommy Emmanuel brings to every note of every song he plays is palpable and infectious. His fans are in love with his unbound talent as a guitarist of multitudes, his ability to play three parts at once, always with pure heart and real soul.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Which brings us to the other aspect of his music always mentioned, and without which the first might not be as powerful or as infectiously appealing: the joy. Yes, joy. Because it's one thing to play these multi-dimensional arrangements flawlessly on an acoustic guitar. But to do it with that smile of the ages, that evidence of authentic, unbridled delight, is an irresistible invitation to feel his music as deeply as he does. \"The joy, he says, \"is there always because I'm chasing it through music. Seeing the surprise in peoples' eyes is worth living and working for... I can't help but play to the people with all my heart, which is overflowing with joy of being in that moment that I've worked all my life for. And here it is!\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Although his expression is instrumental, he comes to the guitar much more like a vocalist, positively singing melodies through the strings. He inhabits the tunes he performs, delivering every nuance and turn of phrase. His own songs are also illuminated always with lyrical melodies that go right to the heart, such as his beautiful ode to his daughter, \"Angelina,\" or his great \"story without words,\" \"Lewis & Clark.\" That they resonate so deeply without words makes sense, as words only go so far. But music, coming from a genuine and joyful source, can go so much farther. Now with The Best of Tommy songs, he brings us a complete collection of his own songs, all rich with ripe melodicism and rendered with joy in real-time.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The inspiration for Tommy was his hero, Chet Atkins. Eventually Tommy met Chet who welcomed him into guitarist knighthood by bestowing upon him the coveted title of CGP (Certified Guitar Player), an honor awarded only to four other humans ever.  From sold out shows all over the world to multiple Grammy nominations, ARIA Awards, IBMA Awards, and countless “Best Acoustic Guitarist” wins in numerous music magazine readers polls…. the world is taking notice.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tommy Emmanuel Front Row Meet & Greet package</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><ul><li> Premium reserved ticket in the front row</li><li> Pre-show Meet & Greet with Tommy Emmanuel CGP</li><li> Autographed 8x10 photo</li><li> Early venue entry</li><li> Early access to merch table</li></ul><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tommy Emmanuel Meet & Greet Package</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><ul><li> Premium reserved ticket in the first 15 rows</li><li> Pre-show Meet & Greet with Tommy Emmanuel CGP</li><li> Autographed 8x10 photo</li><li> Early venue entry</li><li> Early access to merch table</li></ul>------<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>VIP packages powered by Sofar.

Following an incredible sell out tour, Walk Right Back returns to stages in 2025 by popular demand. From the producers of UK's smash hit show That’ll Be The Day, this phenomenal production tells the story of the most successful musical duo of all time – The Everly Brothers. Featuring hits such as Bye Bye Love, All I Have To Do Is Dream and Cathy’s Clown, this unique concert-based musical entwines the wonderful, sad yet glorious story of The Everly Brothers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The show follows the brothers’ rise to fame from humble country beginning to superstardom, through their decade-long feud to their glorious reunion which gave them back to each other, and back to the world.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>With “harmonies from heaven” that inﬂuenced The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and Simon & Garfunkel, The Everly Brothers were unmatched in their talent. Also featuring songs from a couple of the Everly Brothers' good friends, Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Producer Trevor Payne (That’ll Be The Day) says: “The Everly Brothers were an original and unique act that had a sound like nothing else. Their harmonies were so tight that every group wanted to emulate them. Before that there was a singer, a band and backing vocals, The Everly’s entwined all of them and created “the harmony group.” Walk Right Back is the ﬁrst show of its kind to tell this phenomenal story of two brothers and their unforgettable music. This is a show not to be missed!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Pricing</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">Regular: $69.00</span> ($58.50 + $2.10 CIF + $8.40 Ticketing Fee)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">All above prices include GST.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>---<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Kelowna Community Theatre event tickets include a $2.00 Capital Improvement Fee (CIF) and 5% GST.
