  schema:description """
	Unleash the power of your bodily expression as an essential tool in character building and stage movement. This workshop offers an immersive approach to physical theater, inspiring total commitment from the performer-creator, balancing between surrender and childlike play. The focus will be on two areas; the first will focus on exploring the way we express ourselves through gesture and body movement and becoming aware of everything that influences our performance as a scenic sign: planes, directions, movement qualities, voice, viewpoints, emotional connections, volume, and more. The second part will concentrate on uncensored creation, striving to incorporate all aspects of ourselves as performers into their selected piece and its message.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Together we'll cover:<span><br/></span><ul><li>Defending your unique identity as a performer</li><li>Embrace the strength of imperfection.</li><li>Transcending from text to body.</li><li>Discover your poetic universe and apply it to physical expression.</li><li>Using materials in your bodily expressiveness.</li><li>How to use the body as a massive creation weapon.</li><li>The body as an act of love.</li></ul><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">TUITION:</span> $100 per person, includes three Monday evening sessions:<span><br/></span>July 14, 6:30pm-9:00pm<span><br/></span>July 21, 6:30pm-9:00pm<span><br/></span>July 28, 6:30pm-9:00pm<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">INTENDED FOR:</span> Actors and actresses, enthusiasts, dancers, students of Dramatic Arts and Dance, and anyone interested in discovering their inner performer <span class=\"BoldText\">aged 18 or older</span>.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">WHAT TO BRING:</span> Comfy clothes and a memorized theatrical monologue, poem, or text that you love.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">ABOUT THE PRESENTER:</span> Fernando Oyagüez is an actor and creator born in Spain. He studied at the Superior School of Dramatic Art of Castilla and León, and later completed his training at the New York Film Academy, learning from masters like Leticia Santafé (Linklater method), Marta Carrasco (Spanish National Dance Award), and Declan Donnellan, among others. He began his career as a child actor and has appeared in television series such as <span class=\"ItalicText\">Queens: Virgin and Martyr</span> and <span class=\"ItalicText\">45 Revoluciones</span>, and in films like <span class=\"ItalicText\">El comensal</span>, in which he played a leading role, and <span class=\"ItalicText\">Pídeme lo que quieras</span>, which will have its international premiere next November. He has also performed in numerous theater productions such as <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Red Room</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Much Ado About Nothing</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Ugly One</span>, and more. As a creator, he focuses on revitalizing cultural spaces by launching artistic projects that breathe new life into places not originally intended for the performing arts. He is also working on his first feature film, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Protecto</span>, which will be a Spanish-American co-production.

	When disco diva Deloris Van Cartier witnesses a murder, she is put in protective custody in the one place the cops are sure she won't be found: a convent!

  schema:description """
	<span class=\"ItalicText\">The Prince of Egypt</span> is an exciting musical that promises to delight audiences of all ages. Based on the beloved, Oscar-winning DreamWorks Animation film, you'll journey through the wonders of Ancient Egypt as Ramses and Moses, two young men raised together as brothers in a kingdom of privilege, find themselves suddenly divided by a secret past. One must rule as Pharaoh, the other must rise up and free his true people; both face a destiny that will change history forever. <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Prince of Egypt</span> is a sweeping epic with music and lyrics by Grammy and Oscar winner Stephen Schwartz, a book by Philip LaZebnik, and 10 new songs written by Schwartz, together with five of his songs from the film. The show also features Schwartz’s Academy Award-winning song, “When You Believe.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Directed by Wes Curry</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Getting Tickets</h2><span><br/></span>Tickets are $48 for Adults, $25 for Youth under 18 (fees are included in these prices).
