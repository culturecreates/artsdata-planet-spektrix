This concert promises to be a thrilling<span><br/></span>musical extravaganza centered around the captivating theme of \"heroes.\" We have carefully prepared a selection of evocative traditional pieces for this occasion. Among them is the renowned \"General's Command,\" originally part of the string ensemble repertoire collected by Rongzhai in the Qing Dynasty in 1814. This piece has undergone several adaptations and became prominently featured in Hong Kong films and television series related to Wong Fei-hung in the 1940s. Additionally, we will present a suite of six complete movements from the 1959 Chinese dance<span><br/></span>drama \"Dagger Society.\" In addition to the overture, we are delighted to have the soprano Ms. Miao Quanting from the Vancouver Chinese Choir and an elite group from the Vancouver Chorale joining us. Their vocal prowess will add depth and emotion to the concert. Following these classical pieces, the orchestra will showcase modern compositions. First is \"Kamalan,\" composed by<span><br/></span>Taiwanese composer Su Wenqing in 2008, inspired by the mythological stories of the Yilan region (formerly known as Kamalan). Lastly, our concertmaster, Anna Fang, will perform the erhu concerto \"Chu Song,\" composed by prominent Chinese composer Li Bochan in 2014, depicting the historical tale \"Farewell My Concubine.\" We are also pleased to have young musicians from the BC Youth Chinese Orchestra (BCYCO) joining us, sharing their own pieces and collaborating with the BCCO to portray the heroic spirit and scenes embedded in \"Chu Song.\"

Instead, the palace is a cruel and disturbing place where her singular function is to be a baby-making machine for male heirs. Even the other women at her side, a scheming lady-in-waiting and the king’s power-hungry mistress, seem to mostly fend for themselves. The only kinship she finds is with the paperback-romance hot, head-to-toe hair wildman kept in the dungeon as one of the king’s collection of caged oddities. His friendly and feral presence gradually awakens Catherine’s own wild side, and once she unleashes it, no one is safe from her vengeful wrath.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Based on the shocking true story that inspired <span class=\"ItalicText\">Beauty and the Beast</span>, Kat Sandler brings her trademark rapid-fire wit to this salacious saga of an infamous bad girl who could not be tamed.
