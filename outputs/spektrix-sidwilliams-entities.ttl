With a rip-roaring score by Crystle Lightning and Henry Cloud Andrade, and direction by Crystle Lightning, this all-Indigenous concert-style musical infuses hip-hop and comedy into a pow wow-powered love story that’s equal parts hilarious homage and cultural celebration. Captivating audiences across North America, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Bear Grease</span> has had over 200 successful performances over 4 incredible years and is now debuting Off-Broadway. The beloved songs of <span class=\"ItalicText\">Grease</span> are revitalized with vibrant cultural expression and Cree (Nêhiyawêwin) language: “Hopelessly Devoted” becomes a soul-stirring Round Dance, “Bear Grease Lightning” bursts with Traditional, Grass, Chicken, and Fancy footwork, and “Wichihin” delivers a powerful new take on “Stand by Me”.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This production takes the audience on an Indigenous joyride through a parallel universe where colonization never existed. While staying true to some aspects of the original musical, the show revamps certain elements: Sandy wears a ribbon skirt, it’s the Pink Aunties (not the Pink Ladies), Rizzo is Rezzo, and Summer Lovin’ turns into Summer Snaggin’. Bear Grease cleverly fuses Doo Wop, Hip-Hop, and Pow Wow styles with Indigenous fashion, history, and humour, and makes each show reflective of the community it is performed in. If laughter is the best medicine, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Bear Grease</span> – also the name of a sacred Indigenous medicine – is just what the doctor ordered.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"I will see you on Broadway!\" – George R.R.

Choreographed by internationally acclaimed artist Mauricio Wainrot, this electrifying work fuses bold, athletic movement with Carl Orff’s cantata to create a visceral experience that transcends traditional storytelling.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Set to Orff’s thunderous and evocative score, Wainrot’s choreography unfolds through a series of vignettes that mirror the music’s five movements. Each scene pulses with energy and emotion, shifting seamlessly between moments of erratic intensity, tender romanticism, and unabashed sensuality. With sculptural lighting and costuming, and an ensemble of dancers moving as one powerful organism, Carmina Burana becomes more than performance - it becomes like ritual.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>What emerges is a celebration of the human spirit in all its complexity: raw passion, vulnerability, desire, and joy. It’s a work that demands everything of its dancers and leaves audiences exhilarated, moved, and inspired - proving why it remains a standout in the RWB’s repertoire.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Choreography: Mauricio Wainrot<span><br/></span>Music: Carl Orff, Carmina Burana<span><br/></span>Set & Costume Design: Carlos Gallardo<span><br/></span>Lighting Design: David Morrison<span><br/></span>Associate Lighting Design: Robert Mravnik<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">T’əl: The Wild Man of the Woods</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">“T’əl is a powerful fusion of Indigenous storytelling, contemporary ballet, and classical music - rooted in tradition and elevated for the stage.” - The Globe and Mail</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>T’əl: The Wild Man of the Woods marks a bold new chapter in the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s repertoire. Choreographed by RWB School alumnus, choreographer Cameron Fraser-Monroe, this West Coast première unfolds an Indigenous legend through the lens of a fully Indigenous creative team.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Narrated in both English and Ayajuthem by Elder Elsie Paul, the story follows a fearless young woman who sets out to rescue her sister from T’əl, a dark figure who steals children under the cover of night.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The evocative original score is composed by Cris Derksen, a JUNO-nominated, Two-Spirit cellist and composer. With stunning costume design by Asa Benally (Navajo designer and Yale alumnus), T’əl is a powerful fusion of movement, music, and storytelling that honours the richness of oral tradition.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Choreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe<span><br/></span>Oral History Storyteller: Elder Elsie Paul<span><br/></span>Composer: Cris Derksen, Featuring Northern Voice Recording as well as Sheldon & Frazer Sundown<span><br/></span>Costume Design: Asa Benally<span><br/></span>Lighting Design: Scott Henderson<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Cameron Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla'amin First Nation, located on British Columbia’s Sunshine Coast.

	Cirque Kalabanté is a group of amazing acrobats and live musicians celebrating the diversity of traditional African arts combined with the virtuosity of the North American modern circus.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Afrique En Cirque</span> symbolizes the strength, agility and joy of life found in African youth. A handful of daring acrobats perform accompanied by the pulsating rhythm of the djembes of Guinea, and the melodious sound of the Kora. Take a trip to Africa where the sets and costumes pay homage to the Guinean diaspora through high level acrobatics, innovative choreography and colourful rhythms.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Kalabanté Productions was created by Yamoussa Bangoura, a multidisciplinary artist of Guinean origin. As a child, Yamoussa studied the circus performers he saw on European TV and the Nyamakala tradition of circus, practiced by the Fula people of West Africa. He eventually joined Guinea’s original circus company, Circus Baobob. with whom he toured Africa and Europe. Then, in the early 2000s, he was recruited to come to Canada with Cirque Eloize, a Montreal based company, and he also performed with Cirque du Soleil and Cavalia (cirque with horses).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2007 Yamoussa realized his dream and opened his own company Kalabanté Productions in Montreal. He recruited many of his extended family members to join the company, including his twin sisters, brothers, and cousins. His aim was to found a school of circus arts specializing in the African arts. As the company director he develops his own shows that combine these elements and his shows have been performed worldwide.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Yamoussa works to pass on and share his values and passions in the circus arts through his school. He teaches various artistic disciplines, such as African dance and traditional music of West Africa, that in turn helps one to master the circus arts, Kalabante Productions is proud to be able to share their original work, achievements, and also assist with the humanitarian mission to help the Guinean community of which Yamoussa and many of his company members come from.<span><br/></span>

	<span class=\"BoldText\">FONTINE</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Indie-folk/pop artist FONTINE, from Winnipeg, Manitoba, is making waves. A queer and Indigenous musician of Nehiyaw Iskwew heritage, her debut EP, co-produced with friends Kris Ulrich and mixed by Boy Golden, dropped last year. Inspired by the prairies and the Winnipeg music scene, her music is a fusion of culture and creativity. FONTINE's single \"Homemaker\" reached number one on the Indigenous Music Countdown, and she recently graced CBC's \"The Intro\" stage. With roots in her heritage and her home, FONTINE's music is a captivating journey.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"In the first verse of Fontine's title track from her recently released debut EP, </span>Yarrow Lover<span class=\"ItalicText\">, the Winnipeg singer-songwriter lays out some of the reasons why people have flocked to her as a collaborator for years: a beautifully warm voice; an ease and deft on her guitar; a vulnerable sensibility - and a quippy sense of humour.\" - CBC Music</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Zoon</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the Ojibway language, the word Zoongide’ewin means “bravery, courage, the Bear Spirit.” It’s no wonder Daniel Monkman adopted Zoon as their musical moniker. The Hamilton-based musician has spent the better part of their 28 years finding and channeling their strength to overcome such adversities as racism, poverty and addiction.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Music saved Monkman’s life. And, on Zoon’s debut album, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Bleached Wavves</span>, they paint a message of hope and fortitude, lessons they learned studying the Seven Grandfather teachings after experiencing the lowest point of their life.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Bleached Wavves</span> is the first true document of what has been dubbed “moccasin-gaze,” a tongue-in-cheek nickname for the amalgamation of Monkman’s shoegaze influences with traditional First Nations music.

	<h2>Stories and Songs at the Edge of Forgetting</h2><span class=\"ItalicText\">Vancouver Island premiere!</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Written by and featuring Joëlle Rabu and Kelly Wyatt</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Directed by Kymme Patrick</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Music Direction / Arrangements by Nico Rhodes</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">I Don’t Belong Here – Stories and Songs at the Edge of Forgetting</span> is a poignant and powerfully human stage production that explores life inside a dementia care facility through a minimalist theatrical lens. Told through a carefully composed sequence of 15 vignettes and supported by song, the production brings to life 22 distinct characters: memory-care residents navigating shifting realities and blurred recollections; visiting family members grappling with guilt, grief, and the complex emotions of anticipated loss; and compassionate care aides who bear daily witness to the slow unraveling of memory, working to preserve dignity, spark laughter, and nurture connection.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This intimate three-person ensemble piece balances emotional gravity with flashes of absurdity and unexpected levity, illuminating the often surreal and surprisingly tender moments that surface at the edge of forgetting.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>But don’t let the subject matter fool you - this is not a bleak tale. The script deftly weaves vulnerability with humor, sorrow with song, and reflection with resilience, ultimately offering a deeply affirming meditation on love, loss, and the enduring power of human connection.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Musically supported by the bold and aching melodies of the late Harry Nilsson, songs provide a haunting backdrop for this performance exposé.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Joëlle’s compelling vocal interpretations and her chameleon-like portrayals of a dozen featured characters such as the residents, care aids and visiting family members alike are buoyed by Kelly Wyatt’s colourful supporting characters and vocal harmonies, while music director, Nico Rhodes, also playing supporting roles, renders homage with insightful musical arrangements of the timeless musical brilliance of the late Harry Nilsson.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">I Don’t Belong Here</span> reflects on the profound importance of empathy, humour and sensitivity in the journey of caring for our elderly.<span><br/></span>

Their songs of suffering and celebration date back to their 2012 debut <span class=\"ItalicText\">My Father And The Hunter</span>, and the band have obsessively chased big hooks, group vocal exuberance, and folk-rock propulsion through their 2016 breakthrough <span class=\"ItalicText\">Hope</span> to 2024’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Part Time Believer</span>. The Juno and iHeartRadio Music Award-winning group’s new song \"Hard Lines\" gives listeners an urgent, new take on their iconic mix of intimate feelings with stadium folk sounds. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Determined to use every tool in their arsenal to write a good song, The Strumbellas started by looking inward: random song titles, non-sequitur ideas, scraps of paper, and voice memos of half-sung melodies came from everyone in the band. They then connected with their favourite collaborators, songwriters and producers anywhere from their home in Toronto to Vancouver, Nashville, or LA, to create demos that ranged from campfire-chord whispers to radio-ready productions. The long list was then whittled down by the band along with producer Chad Copelin (LANY, Sasha Sloan, Colony House), who recorded the band at his studio in Norman, Oklahoma. Copelin’s finely honed sonic instincts bring out a newly textured, insistently edgy side to The Strumbellas’ alt-folk stomp.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“We’re living in a lonely world,” says keyboardist Dave Ritter. “Whether it’s work or our home life or our screens, life seems cut up into smaller and smaller pieces all disconnected from each other. Hard Lines is about picking your way through the rubble of contemporary life and the hope that we can build things together again. It’s something we’re reminded of when we gather to write or rehearse songs, and when we get to play for people, that music brings us together, gives us some moments of connection that are hard to find these days.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>VIP PACKAGES AVAILABLE</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">VIP 1</span> - Only 6 available<span><br/></span><ul><li>One VIP Tour Bus general admission ticket to see The Strumbellas Live</li><li>Early entry into the venue</li><li>Access to an intimate pre-show hang with the band on their tour bus</li><li>Pre-show acoustic set by The Strumbellas (playing songs not part of their set)</li><li>Q&A session with The Strumbellas</li><li>Group photograph in front of the stage with The Strumbellas</li><li>Limited edition tour poster; autographed by The Strumbellas</li><li>Commemorative VIP laminate & lanyard</li><li>Priority merchandise shopping before general doors</li></ul><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">VIP 2</span><span><br/></span><ul><li>One VIP acoustic general admission ticket to see The Strumbellas Live</li><li>Early entry into the venue</li><li>Pre-show acoustic set by The Strumbellas (playing songs not part of their set)</li><li>Q&A session with The Strumbellas</li><li>Group photograph in front of the stage with The Strumbellas</li><li>Limited edition tour poster; autographed by The Strumbellas</li><li>Commemorative VIP laminate & lanyard</li><li>Priority merchandise shopping before general doors</li></ul>

	Self-described \"Brass House\" trio Too Many Zooz make manically kinetic instrumental music that combines avant-garde jazz, EDM, punk rock, and sundry other traditions into their own distinctive brand of high-energy dance music. A viral sensation since they first emerged as New York subway buskers in 2013, Too Many Zooz have evolved into a globally recognized phenomenon who tour often and produce YouTube videos that have garnered millions of views.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Formed in 2013 in New York City, Too Many Zooz features the talents of baritone saxophonist Leo \"Leo P\" Pellegrino, trumpeter Matt \"Doe\" Muirhead, and drummer David \"King of Sludge\" Parks. Pellegrino and Muirhead initially met while students at the Manhattan School of Music where they studied jazz. They eventually joined forces with percussionist Parks, whom Pellegrino had played with in a separate busking outfit. They began playing live at various New York subway stations and quickly attracted crowds with their aggressive instrumental sound and Pellegrino's ability to dance and hype the audience like a DJ while playing. In 2014, a video of the band went viral and helped set the stage for the group’s meteoric rise.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2016, the trio released their debut full-length album, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Subway Gawdz</span>, which featured guest spots from Kreayshawn, Armani White, members of Galactic, and Beats Antique. That same year they were featured on Beyonce’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Lemonade</span> album, and performed with Beyonce and The Dixie Chicks at the CMA’s.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Over the course of the next several years, Too Many Zooz continued to release EPs and singles – including <span class=\"ItalicText\">ZombiEP</span> (2019), a concept album about a fictional band playing a music festival during a zombie outbreak, plus collaborations and remixes with The Floozies, Beats Antique, Spencer Ludwig, Moon Hooch, Dot Cromwell, Nitty Scott, Lester London, and RoRo. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>All of that set the stage for the band’s 2024 sophomore album <span class=\"ItalicText\">Retail Therapy</span> – a 13-song chronicle of auditory subway cinema that features appearances from Moon Hooch, Thumpasaurus, Lucky Chops, and Too Many T’s.

  schema:description """
	<span class=\"ItalicText\">VACANT LOT</span> from Ichigo Ichieh New Theatre is a contemporary dance and theatre piece directed and choreographed by Hiromoto Ida.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A long-married couple visit the vacant lot where their house once stood. They innocently share memories of their life together, of the house, and of their kids. Soon after, they realize how short this life is, and that our existence in the universe is so fragile.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Lindsay Clague and Hiromoto Ida embody the married couple, storytelling through movement, dialogue, and at times, stillness. This work is a balance between spoken theatre and dance theatre, revealing the loneliness of human existence and our longing to connect to each other and to the universe. While the overarching themes are existential, the play is also filled with delightful comedic moments that tickle the soul.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">VACANT LOT</span> is based on the play “SARACHI” by contemporary Japanese theatre artist, Shogo Ota.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Hiromoto Ida, who is based in Nelson, won a Screen Actors Guild Award this year in the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a TV Drama Series for his portrayal of Japanese warlord Lord Kiyama in <span class=\"ItalicText\">Shōgun</span>.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The production team for <span class=\"ItalicText\">VACANT LOT</span> includes John Tucker (sound designer), Sharon Huizinga (lighting designer), Ian Johnston (stage designer), Lindsay Clague (assistant director), and Hannah Stevens (stage manager).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">About the company</span><span><br/></span>Ichigo Ichieh New Theatre was established in 2006 by Hiromoto Ida. Previous works include “SENTAKU”, “KESSA”, “The Gift”, “DETOUR”, “BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO MYSELF” and “HOMECOMING”.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The company is named after the Japanese notion of a unique occasion. If you meet someone, it is considered a unique occasion that happens only once, in that moment, in an entire lifetime. Even if you meet the same person the next day under the same circumstances, this exact same moment can never reoccur. This idea is built into the philosophy of the Japanese tea ceremony, not unlike a theatre performance, which has a host preparing a ceremony for a guest. Each ceremony is represented by a theme, with subtle intention provided by the host.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Every small thing has a purpose and a position - even imperfections, are carefully attended while the host is kept away from the centre of the ceremony. A tea ceremony’s main focus is always given to perfecting a cup of tea to present to the guest with ichigo-ichieh in their mind.

Two star people and a Buffalo, fall to earth and continue to reconnect throughout history. The play covers seven different periods of Métis history. We bear witness to the emergence of the Métis nations across the plains, the robust colonization that arises from the fur trade, the disappearance of the buffalo and the political uprising of the Métis Association of Alberta. The story begins during creation amongst the stars and ends in the present day.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</span> specifically shares scenarios from the Callihoo family’s stories, incorporating fiddle music, jigging and a life-like buffalo puppet. Inspired by historical events of the Métis people of Canada, this original play for young audiences explores the loves, the losses and the fight of Treaty 6’s Métis people – and their love and kinship to the buffalo.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">CONTENT ADVISORY</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The characters in <span class=\"ItalicText\">Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</span> depict scenes that would have happened in Métis history.

The buffalo dies and is cut up by Marie.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>1885: Louis has a musket in silhouette, we hear gunshots (a depiction of the battle of Batoche).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>1925: Marie and Louis run away from residential school and ascend to the stars (they die).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The musket and the knife are stage props and are representative of the time in history, the situation, are used to tell the story.
