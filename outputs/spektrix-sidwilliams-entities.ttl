Inspired by her late father’s unrealized ambitions, she wants nothing more in life than to be a stand-up comic, and is equal parts thrilled and terrified by the fact that she’s finally old enough to get into a comedy club and actually try her material in front of paying customers. So with a fistful of jokes, and her stalwart friend Kim there to get her back, she heads to the Laughing Hyena, one of New York’s faded comedic hot spots, to hit her first ever open mic night. Glued to his barstool at the back of the room, with his fourth whiskey of the night in hand is Bob Carpenter, and he’s not going to stop heckling until Charlie gives up the microphone. It doesn’t take long before he gets exactly what he wants, and Charlie, chastened, flees the club with Kim on her tail.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When she later returns to the Hyena to talk to the manager Dennis, he tells Charlie that if she really wants to learn the craft, then she’s got to be writing all the time, and studying people who know what they’re doing; people like Bob who, before his marriage and career collapsed and he became an alcoholic heckler, used to be one of the top touring comics in the country. He pulls out some old VHS tapes of the young and energetic performer, first showing him own the crowd with his raw, edgy material, and then in a different clip from his final performance a few years later, literally attacking them. Impressed by this new side of him, and with Dennis’ encouragement, Charlie decides that Bob is going to be her mentor whether he likes it or not, and sets about winning him over. As the two slowly feel each other out, what develops is an unlikely friendship based on broken families, a healthy appreciation of sarcasm, and the undeniable rush of making a whole room full of people laugh.

	<span class=\"ItalicText\">“They are poised for worldwide recognition in a brilliant and unique genre-bending ride through American blues and folk, Gypsy jazz, Native American themes, jump blues, swing and more.” - Duke Robillard (Roomful of Blues, Fabulous Thunderbirds), Award-winning guitar player and producer.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Blue Moon Marquee writes and performs original compositions influenced by anything that swings, jumps or grooves. A.W. Cardinal (vocals/guitar) and Jasmine Colette a.k.a. Badlands Jass (vocals/bass/drums) have played for a vast gamut of crowds at jazz clubs, Lindy Hop dance halls, folk venues, blues haunts, hospitals, prisons, markets, motorcycle joints, dive bars and prestigious festival stages. Colette not only commands the upright bass but also brings the rhythm with her feet on a custom foot drum kit, all while singing in her signature honey-dipped tone. Cardinal’s distinctive and soulful vocals barrel out like a raging bull while his guitar crackles with the swinging energy of jazz-tinged blues.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The result of 9 years of rigorous touring, crisscrossing Europe and North America, is a distinct energy and style from this acclaimed duo. Carving a path through blues, jazz, jump jive, folk, country, swing, and Indigenous soul with an authentic spirit, their sound does not idle easily in one certain category. It stomps and struts through the wilds, conjuring a blend where Howlin’ Wolf tangos with Django, Earnest Tubb shoots firecrackers with Cab Calloway, and Memphis Minnie throws dice with Screamin’ Jay Hawkins. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Their gift is bringing all these elements together without anything sounding out of step. They collect the roots and smoothly braid them with lyrics that often touch on the underbelly of society, woven with elements of Indigenous storytelling and poetic cadence.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"Blue Moon Marquee has its own completely original style. Modern Blues doesn't really get any better than this. This is a tremendous sound by a hugely talented duo” says American Roots UK.\"</span>

	This evening of performance traces the connections between vast ancestral landscapes and our bodies. Unearthed through movement are deep connections to the expansive mountain ranges of North and South America in <span class=\"ItalicText\">Spine of the Mother</span>, the stillness of a winter boreal forest in <span class=\"ItalicText\">Frost Exploding Trees Moon</span>, and the journey of a rushing river in <span class=\"ItalicText\">Confluence</span>.

She finds a place to set up camp, builds her temporary home, and settles into the centre of her world of breath and perception.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The piece tracks a physical human journey as well as a spiritual one.

Jay White has received Neil’s written and verbal approval, while appearing on Neil’s stages. It was here Neil told Jay to “Keep up the good work”. Every moment, every sound, each expression of every song evokes the power and the passion of Neil Diamond. Visually spectacular and warmly familiar, this powerful concert experience is not only a feast for the eyes and ears, but for the heart. Combining the passion of Broadway with the power of a live concert we rediscover his charismatic presence in this uplifting production, complete with a finale of heart pounding patriotic pride!<span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	‘They're on their way, to the city lights’ ... and, THE predominant Canadian Rock ‘n’ Roll band of the 1970s – The Stampeders – are bringing along all their classic hits: <span class=\"ItalicText\">Wild Eyes</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Carry Me</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Oh My Lady, Devil You</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Ramona</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Minstrel Gypsy</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Hit the Road Jack</span> and, of course, the quintessential Canadian – and Hall of Fame – song, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Sweet City Woman!</span> A veritable soundtrack to a whole generation that will ‘carry you home’ ... maybe not to Birmingham ... but back to a time of tie-dyed  t-shirts and elevator shoes, 15¢ coffee and homemade apple pie, dating and dreaming ... By the time The Stampeders get to the first chorus of the first song, everyone will be singing along.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>No seventies group represented Canada's musical identity to the world like The Stampeders. A quick look at Canada's music scene from 1971 until 1976 confirms The Stampeders were truly the country's international musical ambassadors, touring more extensively in Canada and overseas than any other Canadian group during that time.  In 1977 the trio: Rich Dodson (lead guitar), Kim Berly (drums) and Ronnie King (bass) parted company but reunited, fittingly at the Calgary Stampede, 15 years later in 1992. Since then they’ve been recognized by SOCAN for their Lifetime Achievement, been inducted into the SOCAN Songwriters Hall of Fame on five occasions and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame for their 1971 seminal hit <span class=\"ItalicText\">Sweet City Woman</span>. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In March 2024, just before the Ontario leg of this tour, Ronnie King passed away.  In the final days, while in palliative care, he insisted that his band mates carry on.  Dave  Chabot, renowned bassist and long time friend of the band, who was already scheduled to be on the tour to sit in for Ronnie as needed, was the obvious choice.  Still, Ronnie  remains a presence at every show, as Rich and Kim share stories from 50 plus years on the road and pay tribute with a retrospective video.     <span><br/></span>                                                                                                                       <span><br/></span>The enduring musical legacy of The Stampeders  ... <span class=\"ItalicText\">One More Time</span> ... 'better catch a noon train, better get there for a rock 'n' rolling good time!’     <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>
