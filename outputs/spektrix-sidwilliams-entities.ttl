With a rip-roaring score by Crystle Lightning and Henry Cloud Andrade, and direction by Crystle Lightning, this all-Indigenous concert-style musical infuses hip-hop and comedy into a pow wow-powered love story that’s equal parts hilarious homage and cultural celebration. Captivating audiences across North America, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Bear Grease</span> has had over 200 successful performances over 4 incredible years and is now debuting Off-Broadway. The beloved songs of <span class=\"ItalicText\">Grease</span> are revitalized with vibrant cultural expression and Cree (Nêhiyawêwin) language: “Hopelessly Devoted” becomes a soul-stirring Round Dance, “Bear Grease Lightning” bursts with Traditional, Grass, Chicken, and Fancy footwork, and “Wichihin” delivers a powerful new take on “Stand by Me”.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This production takes the audience on an Indigenous joyride through a parallel universe where colonization never existed. While staying true to some aspects of the original musical, the show revamps certain elements: Sandy wears a ribbon skirt, it’s the Pink Aunties (not the Pink Ladies), Rizzo is Rezzo, and \"Summer Lovin’\" turns into \"Summer Snaggin’\". Bear Grease cleverly fuses Doo Wop, Hip-Hop, and Pow Wow styles with Indigenous fashion, history, and humour, and makes each show reflective of the community it is performed in. If laughter is the best medicine, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Bear Grease</span> – also the name of a sacred Indigenous medicine – is just what the doctor ordered.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"I will see you on Broadway!\" – George R.R. Martin (Game of Thrones author)</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">We acknowledge \"Bear Grease the Musical” was written in Treaty 6 Alberta land and traditional territories of the Nehiyaw (Cree), Denesuline’ (Dene), Nakota Sioux (Stoney), Anishinaabe (Saulteaux) and Niitsitapi (Blackfoot).</span><span><br/></span>

	<span class=\"BoldText\">Carmina Burana</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"[This] work never fails to get the heart pumping with its high-octane blend of athletic and sensual choreography exploding with joy.\" - Winnipeg Free Press</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>One of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s most requested productions, Carmina Burana is a feast for the senses - visually stunning, musically absorbing, and emotionally pounding. Choreographed by internationally acclaimed artist Mauricio Wainrot, this electrifying work fuses bold, athletic movement with Carl Orff’s cantata to create a visceral experience that transcends traditional storytelling.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Set to Orff’s thunderous and evocative score, Wainrot’s choreography unfolds through a series of vignettes that mirror the music’s five movements. Each scene pulses with energy and emotion, shifting seamlessly between moments of erratic intensity, tender romanticism, and unabashed sensuality. With sculptural lighting and costuming, and an ensemble of dancers moving as one powerful organism, Carmina Burana becomes more than performance - it becomes like ritual.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>What emerges is a celebration of the human spirit in all its complexity: raw passion, vulnerability, desire, and joy. It’s a work that demands everything of its dancers and leaves audiences exhilarated, moved, and inspired - proving why it remains a standout in the RWB’s repertoire.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Choreography: Mauricio Wainrot<span><br/></span>Music: Carl Orff, Carmina Burana<span><br/></span>Set & Costume Design: Carlos Gallardo<span><br/></span>Lighting Design: David Morrison<span><br/></span>Associate Lighting Design: Robert Mravnik<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">T’əl: The Wild Man of the Woods</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">“T’əl is a powerful fusion of Indigenous storytelling, contemporary ballet, and classical music - rooted in tradition and elevated for the stage.” - The Globe and Mail</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>T’əl: The Wild Man of the Woods marks a bold new chapter in the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s repertoire. Choreographed by RWB School alumnus, choreographer Cameron Fraser-Monroe, this West Coast première unfolds an Indigenous legend through the lens of a fully Indigenous creative team.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Narrated in both English and Ayajuthem by Elder Elsie Paul, the story follows a fearless young woman who sets out to rescue her sister from T’əl, a dark figure who steals children under the cover of night.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The evocative original score is composed by Cris Derksen, a JUNO-nominated, Two-Spirit cellist and composer. With stunning costume design by Asa Benally (Navajo designer and Yale alumnus), T’əl is a powerful fusion of movement, music, and storytelling that honours the richness of oral tradition.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Choreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe<span><br/></span>Oral History Storyteller: Elder Elsie Paul<span><br/></span>Composer: Cris Derksen, Featuring Northern Voice Recording as well as Sheldon & Frazer Sundown<span><br/></span>Costume Design: Asa Benally<span><br/></span>Lighting Design: Scott Henderson<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Cameron Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla'amin First Nation, located on British Columbia’s Sunshine Coast.

	Cirque Kalabanté is a group of amazing acrobats and live musicians celebrating the diversity of traditional African arts combined with the virtuosity of the North American modern circus.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Afrique En Cirque</span> symbolizes the strength, agility and joy of life found in African youth. A handful of daring acrobats perform accompanied by the pulsating rhythm of the djembes of Guinea, and the melodious sound of the Kora. Take a trip to Africa where the sets and costumes pay homage to the Guinean diaspora through high level acrobatics, innovative choreography and colourful rhythms.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Kalabanté Productions was created by Yamoussa Bangoura, a multidisciplinary artist of Guinean origin. As a child, Yamoussa studied the circus performers he saw on European TV and the Nyamakala tradition of circus, practiced by the Fula people of West Africa. He eventually joined Guinea’s original circus company, Circus Baobob. with whom he toured Africa and Europe. Then, in the early 2000s, he was recruited to come to Canada with Cirque Eloize, a Montreal based company, and he also performed with Cirque du Soleil and Cavalia (cirque with horses).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2007 Yamoussa realized his dream and opened his own company Kalabanté Productions in Montreal. He recruited many of his extended family members to join the company, including his twin sisters, brothers, and cousins. His aim was to found a school of circus arts specializing in the African arts. As the company director he develops his own shows that combine these elements and his shows have been performed worldwide.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Yamoussa works to pass on and share his values and passions in the circus arts through his school. He teaches various artistic disciplines, such as African dance and traditional music of West Africa, that in turn helps one to master the circus arts, Kalabante Productions is proud to be able to share their original work, achievements, and also assist with the humanitarian mission to help the Guinean community of which Yamoussa and many of his company members come from.<span><br/></span>

	<span class=\"BoldText\">FONTINE</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Indie-folk/pop artist FONTINE, from Winnipeg, Manitoba, is making waves. A queer and Indigenous musician of Nehiyaw Iskwew heritage, her debut EP, co-produced with friends Kris Ulrich and mixed by Boy Golden, dropped last year. Inspired by the prairies and the Winnipeg music scene, her music is a fusion of culture and creativity. FONTINE's single \"Homemaker\" reached number one on the Indigenous Music Countdown, and she recently graced CBC's \"The Intro\" stage. With roots in her heritage and her home, FONTINE's music is a captivating journey.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"In the first verse of Fontine's title track from her recently released debut EP, </span>Yarrow Lover<span class=\"ItalicText\">, the Winnipeg singer-songwriter lays out some of the reasons why people have flocked to her as a collaborator for years: a beautifully warm voice; an ease and deft on her guitar; a vulnerable sensibility - and a quippy sense of humour.\" - CBC Music</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Zoon</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the Ojibway language, the word Zoongide’ewin means “bravery, courage, the Bear Spirit.” It’s no wonder Daniel Monkman adopted Zoon as their musical moniker. The Hamilton-based musician has spent the better part of their 28 years finding and channeling their strength to overcome such adversities as racism, poverty and addiction.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Music saved Monkman’s life. And, on Zoon’s debut album, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Bleached Wavves</span>, they paint a message of hope and fortitude, lessons they learned studying the Seven Grandfather teachings after experiencing the lowest point of their life.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Bleached Wavves</span> is the first true document of what has been dubbed “moccasin-gaze,” a tongue-in-cheek nickname for the amalgamation of Monkman’s shoegaze influences with traditional First Nations music. Like My Bloody Valentine’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Loveless</span>, a record that changed everything for them, Zoon pushes forward that famously quixotic, effects-laden sound with a distinctive, new approach. <span><br/></span>

Upon its emergence in 1997, this revolutionary travelling music festival, helmed by superstar Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan and featuring exclusively women or women-led acts, exploded the notion that popular music could only support a token quota of women’s voices. This galvanizing documentary from director Ally Pankiw (<span class=\"ItalicText\">I Used To Be Funny</span>) chronicles Lilith Fair’s triumphant three-year run and features new interviews with key performers such as Jewel, Bonnie Raitt, Erykah Badu, and Emmylou Harris.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The legacy of Lilith Fair lives on, and with beautifully integrated performances, backstage footage, and intimate interviews, Pankiw's inspiring film tells us why.

  schema:description """
	The Strumbellas know that misery loves company, and that if we’re together, even in dark times, there’s some joy in that. Their songs of suffering and celebration date back to their 2012 debut <span class=\"ItalicText\">My Father And The Hunter</span>, and the band have obsessively chased big hooks, group vocal exuberance, and folk-rock propulsion through their 2016 breakthrough <span class=\"ItalicText\">Hope</span> to 2024’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Part Time Believer</span>. The Juno and iHeartRadio Music Award-winning group’s new song \"Hard Lines\" gives listeners an urgent, new take on their iconic mix of intimate feelings with stadium folk sounds. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Determined to use every tool in their arsenal to write a good song, The Strumbellas started by looking inward: random song titles, non-sequitur ideas, scraps of paper, and voice memos of half-sung melodies came from everyone in the band. They then connected with their favourite collaborators, songwriters and producers anywhere from their home in Toronto to Vancouver, Nashville, or LA, to create demos that ranged from campfire-chord whispers to radio-ready productions. The long list was then whittled down by the band along with producer Chad Copelin (LANY, Sasha Sloan, Colony House), who recorded the band at his studio in Norman, Oklahoma. Copelin’s finely honed sonic instincts bring out a newly textured, insistently edgy side to The Strumbellas’ alt-folk stomp.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“We’re living in a lonely world,” says keyboardist Dave Ritter. “Whether it’s work or our home life or our screens, life seems cut up into smaller and smaller pieces all disconnected from each other. Hard Lines is about picking your way through the rubble of contemporary life and the hope that we can build things together again. It’s something we’re reminded of when we gather to write or rehearse songs, and when we get to play for people, that music brings us together, gives us some moments of connection that are hard to find these days.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>VIP PACKAGES AVAILABLE</h2><span class=\"BoldText\">VIP 1</span> - Only 6 available<span><br/></span><ul><li>One VIP Tour Bus general admission ticket to see The Strumbellas Live</li><li>Early entry into the venue</li><li>Access to an intimate pre-show hang with the band on their tour bus</li><li>Pre-show acoustic set by The Strumbellas (playing songs not part of their set)</li><li>Q&A session with The Strumbellas</li><li>Group photograph in front of the stage with The Strumbellas</li><li>Limited edition tour poster; autographed by The Strumbellas</li><li>Commemorative VIP laminate & lanyard</li><li>Priority merchandise shopping before general doors</li></ul><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">VIP 2</span><span><br/></span><ul><li>One VIP acoustic general admission ticket to see The Strumbellas Live</li><li>Early entry into the venue</li><li>Pre-show acoustic set by The Strumbellas (playing songs not part of their set)</li><li>Q&A session with The Strumbellas</li><li>Group photograph in front of the stage with The Strumbellas</li><li>Limited edition tour poster; autographed by The Strumbellas</li><li>Commemorative VIP laminate & lanyard</li><li>Priority merchandise shopping before general doors</li></ul>

  schema:description """
	Tonye Aganaba is a Black African queer, disabled and non-binary immigrant and uninvited settler living on the unceded ancestral territories of the Musqueam, Squamish & Tsleil-Waututh First Nations. They were born in London, England - the belly of the beast and the stronghold of imperialism, colonialism and racial capitalism, and immigrated to so-called Canada at the age of 13. They proudly trace their ancestral line to the lands known today as Nigeria and Zimbabwe.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tonye is an interdisciplinary artist and musician - and their style is dynamic and fluid - weaving playful threads of Soul, Neo-Folk, Funk, Hip-Hop and R&B. Their shows, gatherings, and workshops are connected and intimate experiences, and evoke a kind of vulnerability that we all hunger for. They are a steadfast fixture in their local arts community - and a passionate and political being.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When they’re not on stage or in the studio - they’re actively unlearning and re-learning as a community worker and organizer working in solidarity with oppressed peoples and in defense of the planet, in an effort to decolonize body, mind, spirit and space. You can find them organizing with Defund 604 Network, Community Accountability Project, Ethos Lab, and Cops Out Of Schools - four collectives based in so-called Vancouver that are dedicated to creating safe and healthy spaces for all.

  schema:name "Too Many Zooz: Caravan Tour";
  schema:description """
	Self-described \"Brass House\" trio Too Many Zooz make manically kinetic instrumental music that combines avant-garde jazz, EDM, punk rock, and sundry other traditions into their own distinctive brand of high-energy dance music. A viral sensation since they first emerged as New York subway buskers in 2013, Too Many Zooz have evolved into a globally recognized phenomenon who tour often and produce YouTube videos that have garnered millions of views.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Formed in 2013 in New York City, Too Many Zooz features the talents of baritone saxophonist Leo \"Leo P\" Pellegrino, trumpeter Matt \"Doe\" Muirhead, and drummer David \"King of Sludge\" Parks. Pellegrino and Muirhead initially met while students at the Manhattan School of Music where they studied jazz. They eventually joined forces with percussionist Parks, whom Pellegrino had played with in a separate busking outfit. They began playing live at various New York subway stations and quickly attracted crowds with their aggressive instrumental sound and Pellegrino's ability to dance and hype the audience like a DJ while playing. In 2014, a video of the band went viral and helped set the stage for the group’s meteoric rise.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2016, the trio released their debut full-length album, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Subway Gawdz</span>, which featured guest spots from Kreayshawn, Armani White, members of Galactic, and Beats Antique. That same year they were featured on Beyonce’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Lemonade</span> album, and performed with Beyonce and The Dixie Chicks at the CMA’s.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Over the course of the next several years, Too Many Zooz continued to release EPs and singles – including <span class=\"ItalicText\">ZombiEP</span> (2019), a concept album about a fictional band playing a music festival during a zombie outbreak, plus collaborations and remixes with The Floozies, Beats Antique, Spencer Ludwig, Moon Hooch, Dot Cromwell, Nitty Scott, Lester London, and RoRo. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>All of that set the stage for the band’s 2024 sophomore album <span class=\"ItalicText\">Retail Therapy</span> – a 13-song chronicle of auditory subway cinema that features appearances from Moon Hooch, Thumpasaurus, Lucky Chops, and Too Many T’s.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Opener: ZADA</span><span><br/></span>In a world where everything is increasingly virtual, ZADA is tethered to nature. Ethiopia-born and Canada-based, the 20-year-old was raised in the snowy mountains of Whistler, British Columbia. This natural environment informs ZADA’s singular musical voice, a fresh blend of neo-soul and R&B with generous doses of Afrobeat and folk, propelled by organic grooves and breezy melodies.

  schema:description """
	The Comox Valley Community Foundation presents a free community screening of the ground breaking documentary UnCharitable.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">What if charity could be transformed from a gesture to an answer— to solving the world’s greatest problems?</span> What if everything we’ve been taught about charitable giving is wrong? What if it’s undermining the very causes, we love the most? “Uncharitable” is a one-of-a-kind movie that shows how our charitable traditions and prejudices have suffocated the charitable sector and prevented it from leading the charge to truly change the world.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Based on the book, “Uncharitable,” by Dan Pallotta, which became one of the most talked-about TED talks of all time—changing everything from charity watchdog standards to the giving practices of America’s biggest foundations — Uncharitable follows the stories of four iconic American charitable efforts that were crippled or destroyed by old ideas. Step-by-step, and with a chorus of leading voices in the field, the movie shows how charity’s real power has been misunderstood and undermined by anachronistic ideas about frugality and<span><br/></span>deprivation and takes the viewer on a journey from sach-cloth and ashes to a place where unleashed, charities can play the leading role in creating an unimaginably beautiful world that works for everyone.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>No topic is more crucial or timelier as we confront a world with increasingly complex problems, with the least of us left behind, and with the growing revelation that we are all interconnected and that our fate lies in our willingness to turn away from old ideas that have not worked and embraced radically new ones that can.<span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	<span class=\"ItalicText\">VACANT LOT</span> from Ichigo Ichieh New Theatre is a contemporary dance and theatre piece directed and choreographed by Hiromoto Ida.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A long-married couple visit the vacant lot where their house once stood. They innocently share memories of their life together, of the house, and of their kids. Soon after, they realize how short this life is, and that our existence in the universe is so fragile.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Lindsay Clague and Hiromoto Ida embody the married couple, storytelling through movement, dialogue, and at times, stillness. This work is a balance between spoken theatre and dance theatre, revealing the loneliness of human existence and our longing to connect to each other and to the universe. While the overarching themes are existential, the play is also filled with delightful comedic moments that tickle the soul.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">VACANT LOT</span> is based on the play “SARACHI” by contemporary Japanese theatre artist, Shogo Ota.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Hiromoto Ida, who is based in Nelson, won a Screen Actors Guild Award this year in the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a TV Drama Series for his portrayal of Japanese warlord Lord Kiyama in <span class=\"ItalicText\">Shōgun</span>.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The production team for <span class=\"ItalicText\">VACANT LOT</span> includes John Tucker (sound designer), Sharon Huizinga (lighting designer), Ian Johnston (stage designer), Lindsay Clague (assistant director), and Hannah Stevens (stage manager).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">About the company</span><span><br/></span>Ichigo Ichieh New Theatre was established in 2006 by Hiromoto Ida. Previous works include “SENTAKU”, “KESSA”, “The Gift”, “DETOUR”, “BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO MYSELF” and “HOMECOMING”.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The company is named after the Japanese notion of a unique occasion. If you meet someone, it is considered a unique occasion that happens only once, in that moment, in an entire lifetime. Even if you meet the same person the next day under the same circumstances, this exact same moment can never reoccur. This idea is built into the philosophy of the Japanese tea ceremony, not unlike a theatre performance, which has a host preparing a ceremony for a guest. Each ceremony is represented by a theme, with subtle intention provided by the host.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Every small thing has a purpose and a position - even imperfections, are carefully attended while the host is kept away from the centre of the ceremony. A tea ceremony’s main focus is always given to perfecting a cup of tea to present to the guest with ichigo-ichieh in their mind.
