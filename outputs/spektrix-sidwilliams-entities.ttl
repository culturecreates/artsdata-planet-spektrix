  schema:name "100UP";
  schema:description """
	100UP is a film which investigates the will to live. It portrays a colourful selection of 100+ year old people from all over the world. They have lived for over a century and witnessed great historical events, but instead of dwelling on the past, they look ahead. With the clock inevitably ticking, these centenarians cling to life, set new goals with a joie de vivre, refusing to admit the betrayal of their deteriorating bodies. Time is both their enemy and their friend. They have overcome diseases, lost partners and often survived their own children. Nevertheless, these active, curious and creative 100+ year olds are amazingly good at restarting every new day.

A.W. Cardinal (vocals/guitar) and Jasmine Colette a.k.a. Badlands Jass (vocals/bass/drums) have played for a vast gamut of crowds at jazz clubs, Lindy Hop dance halls, folk venues, blues haunts, hospitals, prisons, markets, motorcycle joints, dive bars and prestigious festival stages. Colette not only commands the upright bass but also brings the rhythm with her feet on a custom foot drum kit, all while singing in her signature honey-dipped tone. Cardinal’s distinctive and soulful vocals barrel out like a raging bull while his guitar crackles with the swinging energy of jazz-tinged blues.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The result of 9 years of rigorous touring, crisscrossing Europe and North America, is a distinct energy and style from this acclaimed duo. Carving a path through blues, jazz, jump jive, folk, country, swing, and Indigenous soul with an authentic spirit, their sound does not idle easily in one certain category. It stomps and struts through the wilds, conjuring a blend where Howlin’ Wolf tangos with Django, Earnest Tubb shoots firecrackers with Cab Calloway, and Memphis Minnie throws dice with Screamin’ Jay Hawkins. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Their gift is bringing all these elements together without anything sounding out of step. They collect the roots and smoothly braid them with lyrics that often touch on the underbelly of society, woven with elements of Indigenous storytelling and poetic cadence.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"Blue Moon Marquee has its own completely original style. Modern Blues doesn't really get any better than this. This is a tremendous sound by a hugely talented duo” says American Roots UK.\"</span>

However, his macho father and village leader, Stoik the Vast, will not allow his small, clumsy, but inventive son to do so. Regardless, Hiccup ventures out into battle and downs a mysterious Night Fury dragon with his invention, but can't bring himself to kill it. Instead, Hiccup and the dragon, whom he dubs Toothless, begin a friendship that would open up both their worlds as the observant boy learns that his people have misjudged the species. But even as the two each take flight in their own way, they find that they must fight the destructive ignorance plaguing their world. Starring Craig Ferguson, Gerard Butler, Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Kristen Wiig, and Jonah Hill.

	There are some artists who happen to be in the right place at the right time... that moment when the door is still slightly open and there’s just enough space to sneak through.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Then there are those artists who find themselves standing in front of a closed door, but instead of waiting for it to open they kick it in to go through. In the rise of Spoken Word’s popularity, that open door cannot be discussed without saying the name Shane Koyczan. In 2010, the world caught a glimpse of Koyczan’s prodigious talent with his presentation at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. This stand-out performance helped shine a light on this street poet from Vancouver’s downtown east side.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Shane had been an artist, inches away from living on the street, who even in those troubled times was putting out work like To This Day, a video that’s garnered 24 million views and is used worldwide in classrooms as a teaching tool, as well in speech and forensic competitions. His second book, Stickboy, was adapted into an opera by Vancouver Opera. His voice has been sought after by luminaries like George Miller, who worked with Shane on Mad Max: Fury Road. Koyczan also created the piece, Shoulders, which he toured with David Suzuki as part of The Blue Dot Tour, a movement to enshrine environmental rights in the constitution.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A collaborator with artists such as Ani DiFranco, Dan Mangan, Tanya Tagaq, and others, Koyczan has elevated the art form of Spoken Word from its humble beginnings in after-hour cafes to stages both grand and distant. Shane brings an authenticity to his work that connects with audiences, as evidenced by his fiercely honest TED Talk, which highlights the kind of humanity he brings to each performance. Not just a poet moving on from one subject to the next, Shane weaves his pieces together in a spellbinding narrative that show audiences themes that stretch over our lives. Koyczan continues to trek through the difficult parts of our existence with humour in heart, and a notepad in hand; he scribbles down the whispers inside us and uses laughter as a poultice to press against our wounds.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2017 Shane invited us deep into family trauma with the documentary Shut Up And Say Something, an emotional trip through his past as he comes to terms with his estranged father. The film went on to win Most Popular Documentary at Vancouver <span><br/></span>International Film Festival, moving audiences with its bravery and vulnerability. After a number of critical successes in the book world, Shane chose to depart from convention and carve out his own path as an independent artist. Koyczan launched his own publishing house, Stickboy Press, whose first collection was brought to life by a crowd funding campaign in which 1,688 backers pledged $91,154 to make A Bruise On Light, a Guinness record holder as the most money raised through crowdfunding for a book of poetry. Shane followed this success by publishing two graphic novels, Silence Is A Song I Know All The Words To and Turn On A Light.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>It feels safe to say that there seems no territory beyond the reach of Koyczan’s pen or of his heart. An artist whose work has transgressed genres and given breath to a new generation of voices, Shane Koyczan wears the mantle of human and dares others to discover what that means.

Sharma began singing professionally for the first time on the First Impressions stage in 1989 and returns now with this bravura performance one can only describe as so sublime, it's like a shot of morphine; for a blissful few minutes all the cares of the world are gone.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>You are invited to an audience with Judy Garland, Patsy Cline, Edith Piaf, Billie Holiday and Maria Callas. Accompanied by live musicians, Sharma’s miraculous voice shifts from the smoky blues of Holiday to the thrilling soprano of Maria Callas via Garland, Cline, and Piaf. With consummate ease, she breathes new life and deeper meaning into the five legendary performers and the five ordinary women whose lives were changed by their brush with fame.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When Sharma lets her voice float out over the anonymous crowd, or form the grooves of thousands of records, or flow through radios into millions of homes across the world, she makes countless unknown connections with people. The singer has her story and the listener hers, and should those stories touch each other, there can be magic. There will be magic. Featuring such favourites as “Come Rain or Come Shine,” “Crazy,” and “Ain’t Nobody’s Business If I Do,” <span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">Songs For Nobodies</span></span> illuminates the power of song to share a story, heal a heartbreak, and inspire a dream. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">“Sharma is remarkable and compelling; her singing is thrilling and her characters diverse and sympathetic… she is a consummate performer… bravissima.”</span><span><br/></span>

  schema:name "The Death Tour";
  schema:description """
	Each winter, when the lakes freeze over, a motley gang of professional wrestlers leaves Winnipeg on a one-of-a-kind wrestling trip through remote Indigenous communities of Northern Manitoba. Wrestling insiders call it the ‘Death Tour’ - both for the physical hardships endured on the road and the emotional toll it takes on those who experience it. Famous for its star-studded alumni, the trip offers wrestlers a rare taste of fame and a chance to see if they have what it takes to make it in professional wrestling.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Death Tour is a road trip movie like none other which takes viewers on an epic journey to a part of the world rarely captured on camera. Experience these remote communities through the wrestlers eyes as they drive through the frozen tundra, sleep on ring mats after shows, and face their inner demons. Some hope that surviving the Death Tour will propel them to wrestling superstardom while others, their bodies battered and scarred, head North for one last chance to hear the roar of an adoring crowd. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For the communities these wrestlers visit, The Death Tour is a not-to-be-missed event. The wrestlers are celebrities for kids in these towns, which is why they are invited to speak at schools about battles fought in their own lives. Sage “The Matriarch” Morin, talks about her struggles after the loss of her 2 year old son to a drunk driver. Wrestling brought her back from the brink and performing for Indigenous youth has given her life new purpose. Veteran wrestler Sean “Massive Damage” Dunster tears up as he tells local kids about his battle with pain killers. For years doctors have warned him his next match could be his last - but Sean’s not ready to give up the life just yet. Dez “The Eskimofo” Loreen, a self-trained Inuit wrestler from Inuvik, had his own struggles with mental health and substance abuse before he decided to bring wrestling to the Arctic. He’s joined the tour to learn the moves he’ll need to wow crowds back home. Sarah “The Scottish Warrior” McNicoll hopes wrestling will give her a second chance at life as a pro athlete. The sport is a healthy outlet for the rage and regret she feels at being forced to give up on her Olympic dream in her teens.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Keeping it all together is Tony Condello the tour’s promoter. At 81, this will be his 50th Death Tour. Tony’s a wrestling icon who’s helped shape the careers of many wrestling greats. He hopes to continue putting on tours for Indigenous fans for years to come. The Death Tour is a meditation on the inner strength some discover when alone, exhausted and pushed to the limit. This deeply personal documentary travels through Canada’s frozen North and into the wrestlers’ minds as they battle the elements, each other, and the impacts of our colonial past. The wrestlers and their fans will draw upon vastly different pasts to come together over their shared love of wrestling.

  schema:description """
	‘They're on their way, to the city lights’ ... and, THE predominant Canadian Rock ‘n’ Roll band of the 1970s – The Stampeders – are bringing along all their classic hits: <span class=\"ItalicText\">Wild Eyes</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Carry Me</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Oh My Lady, Devil You</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Ramona</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Minstrel Gypsy</span>, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Hit the Road Jack</span> and, of course, the quintessential Canadian – and Hall of Fame – song, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Sweet City Woman!</span> A veritable soundtrack to a whole generation that will ‘carry you home’ ... maybe not to Birmingham ... but back to a time of tie-dyed  t-shirts and elevator shoes, 15¢ coffee and homemade apple pie, dating and dreaming ... By the time The Stampeders get to the first chorus of the first song, everyone will be singing along.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>No seventies group represented Canada's musical identity to the world like The Stampeders. A quick look at Canada's music scene from 1971 until 1976 confirms The Stampeders were truly the country's international musical ambassadors, touring more extensively in Canada and overseas than any other Canadian group during that time.  In 1977 the trio: Rich Dodson (lead guitar), Kim Berly (drums) and Ronnie King (bass) parted company but reunited, fittingly at the Calgary Stampede, 15 years later in 1992. Since then they’ve been recognized by SOCAN for their Lifetime Achievement, been inducted into the SOCAN Songwriters Hall of Fame on five occasions and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame for their 1971 seminal hit <span class=\"ItalicText\">Sweet City Woman</span>. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In March 2024, just before the Ontario leg of this tour, Ronnie King passed away.  In the final days, while in palliative care, he insisted that his band mates carry on.  Dave  Chabot, renowned bassist and long time friend of the band, who was already scheduled to be on the tour to sit in for Ronnie as needed, was the obvious choice.  Still, Ronnie  remains a presence at every show, as Rich and Kim share stories from 50 plus years on the road and pay tribute with a retrospective video.     <span><br/></span>                                                                                                                       <span><br/></span>The enduring musical legacy of The Stampeders  ... <span class=\"ItalicText\">One More Time</span> ... 'better catch a noon train, better get there for a rock 'n' rolling good time!’     <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>

  schema:name "The Wildflowers: Tribute to Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers";
  schema:description """
	The international touring band The Wildflowers are North America’s #1 Tribute to Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Who doesn’t love Tom Petty?” bassist Darryell Stone asked himself one day in 2012 while listening to the radio. There was only one answer he could imagine, “Nobody.” Testing his hypothesis, Stone polled friends, family and fellow musicians how they felt about Petty. The result was always the same. Everyone loves Tom Petty.<span><br/></span>One of these fellow musicians just happened to be Tom Petty’s doppelganger, guitarist and lead vocalist Jonathan Guthrie. Guthrie was an avid fan and had always fantasized about being a Heartbreaker. As two seasoned musicians and Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers fans, there was really only one thing for them to do – form a Tom Petty tribute band. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>It wasn’t hard for Stone and Guthrie to find skilled musicians excited about playing in a Tom Petty tribute band. Drummer Steve Lucas, formerly of Feverdog and a bandmate of Stone’s local band, Theatrix, quickly signed on. Lucas brought with him his M-80’s band mate Glenn Freeman. Freeman, who boasts of seeing multiple Tom Petty concerts in the 80s, brought an instrumental cornucopia to the group with keyboards, harmonica, guitar and backing vocals. Lead guitarist Curt Granger rounded out the lineup. With 30+ years experience in Birmingham’s local music scene, Granger has played in such circuit bands as Pyrate, Scream Sophie, and his own solo project, as well as creating a line of world-renowned boutique guitar amplifiers. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The new Tom Petty tribute band rehearsed with one focus – to recreate the music of Tom Petty with precision, attention to detail, and a reverent respect. Parts were studied in great detail, down to inflections in the very way each word of every lyric was sung. <span><br/></span>Performing locally in the first year, it didn’t take long for the band to be noticed. Word spread quickly, which led to more shows outside the band’s home state, which led to more word of mouth and exposure. Soon the band was gaining interest from venues across the southeast, which led to more travel and more Tom Petty fans discovering them. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Jump ahead 100 shows and The Wildflowers have become one of the most popular tribute shows across the southeast US, and quickly gaining recognition in other regions. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Equipped with decades of experience and a passion for Tom Petty’s magic way with songs, The Wildflowers bring music lovers of all stripes what they adore. More Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers<span><br/></span>

  schema:name "Tower of Song: A Creative Tribute to Leonard Cohen";
  schema:description """
	<span class=\"ItalicText\">\"I said to Hank Williams, how lonely does it get? <span><br/></span>Hank Williams hasn't answered yet <span><br/></span>But I hear him coughing all night long <span><br/></span>A hundred floors above me, In the Tower of Song\"</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When Leonard Cohen sang these words, the Tower of Song was a metaphor for the inspiration that flows between songwriters, each toiling away on their own, but connected by their shared craft. Moved by this concept, celebrated BC singer songwriters Oliver Swain(WCMA winner and Juno nominee) and Glenna Garramone, collaborated to produce a project that is a dialogue through song and a tribute to the legendary songwriter. Reimagining both rare and classic works of Cohen, the duo have crafted a sound that resonates with both longtime Cohen fans and a younger audience.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.towerofsongmusic.com/\"> Tower of Song</a> began as a one-off tribute night for a packed house at Vancouver's The Media Club, and has since grown into an actively touring folk duo. Produced by Garramone, she invited fellow Victoria musician Oliver Swain, and the show gave Swain and Garramone the chance to grow their musical chemistry. Together as Tower of Song the two have arranged some of Cohen's timeless songs beautifully, for two voices, banjo, string bass, piano and guitar. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Encouraged by the audience response, they continued to present the show regionally, and after several sold-out shows on Vancouver Island and a successful tour of BC and Alberta, Tower of Song put \"more power in the tower,\" recording their debut album <span class=\"BoldText\">In City and In Forest</span>, with Juno award winning producer Joby Baker. They have since toured twice across BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, playing more than 200 shows to thousands of people in theatres and folk clubs across Canada. Highlights include a mainstage performance at the Salmon Arm Roots & Blues Festival, and sold out shows at Rotary Centre for the Arts in Kelowna, the Dave Dunnet Theatre in Victoria, the West End Cultural Centre in Winnipeg, and Aeolian Hall (London). CBC News BC named the Tower of Song live show as #1 of the top 5 things to check out over the weekend when they played at Centennial Theatre in North Vancouver. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">\"The tunes are hauntingly lovely. Wonderful takes with close harmonies and violent re-rhythmings. Musically sound. Faithful by being strongly, creatively Cohen, and yet wholly their own.\"</span><span><br/></span>- James N. Porter, Professor Emeritus (Arts), York University <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Oliver Swain</span> <span><br/></span>x Western Canada Music Award winning and Juno nominated Americana Folk Noir musician Oliver Swain spent a dozen years in some of North America's most loved roots bands <span class=\"ItalicText\">(Outlaw Social, The Duhks, The Bills)</span> before going solo and releasing <span class=\"BoldText\">In a BIG MACHINE</span> in to rave reviews, #1 spots on the charts, sold out shows and festival appearances across western Canada. A naturalist musician who was drawn to Louisiana and Appalachia several times to discover the roots of American music for himself, Oliver resides in Victoria, BC where frequent journeys into the rugged BC wilderness fuel his songwriting, singing and playing styles. Performing on Banjo and String Bass, led by tremendous vocal abilities, Oliver's live show has attracted a lot of attention over the years including that of Tamara Kater, Executive Director of Folk Music Canada: \"Since I first discovered him in 2008, Oliver Swain has been one of my very favorite artists... an evening spent with Oliver Swain will leave you breathless and joyful.\" <span><br/></span>Visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.oliverswain.com/\"> Oliver Swain</a> for more info.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Glenna Garramone</span><span><br/></span>Based in Victoria, BC, Canada, Glenna Garramone is equally at home as a solo artist and in collaboration with a wide range of performers. Career highlights include mainstage performances at Telluride Bluegrass Festival, the Vancouver Folk Festival, and Rifflandia, as a keyboard player and vocalist for the band Shane Koyczan and the Short Story Long, with whom she co-wrote for their most recent album, Debris (featuring guest Ani DiFranco). With a style somewhere between Keith Jarrett and Joni Mitchell, Glenna Garramone's songwriting earned her Grand prize in the Artswells Songwriting Contest, and the award-winning song \"Bear Scat\" was featured on CBC Radio's North By Northwest with Sheryl MacKay. Inspired by the geography, inhabitants, and spirit of the places she has lived, from Nunavut to Hawaii, Glenna Garramone crafts \"raw, emotional, and utterly captivating\" songs (John Threlfall, Monday Magazine), using anything from piano, to guitar, to her tap shoes. She also holds a BFA in Writing from the University of Victoria, with a major in Poetry. Glenna is founder and director of The Pandora Chorus, an indie-pop-rock choir.<span><br/></span>Visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.glennagarramone.com/\"> Glenna Marrone</a> for more info.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

This local history speaks to systemic racial injustice towards Vancouver’s Black community that has continued to this day. Revelatory conversations are had in the film surrounding the erasure of Black history in Canada, and the proliferation of hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan which had chapters in Vancouver. Histories of now-closed Black-owned businesses in Hogan’s Alley such as Vie’s Chicken and Steakhouse have inspired a new generation of Black business owners in the neighbourhood, and the Black Lives Matter movement has reinvigorated discussion surrounding the destruction, as well as the history and memory of Hogan’s Alley.
