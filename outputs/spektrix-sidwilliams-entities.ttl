	<span class=\"BoldText\">Carmina Burana</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">\"[This] work never fails to get the heart pumping with its high-octane blend of athletic and sensual choreography exploding with joy.\" - Winnipeg Free Press</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>One of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s most requested productions, Carmina Burana is a feast for the senses - visually stunning, musically absorbing, and emotionally pounding. Choreographed by internationally acclaimed artist Mauricio Wainrot, this electrifying work fuses bold, athletic movement with Carl Orff’s cantata to create a visceral experience that transcends traditional storytelling.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Set to Orff’s thunderous and evocative score, Wainrot’s choreography unfolds through a series of vignettes that mirror the music’s five movements. Each scene pulses with energy and emotion, shifting seamlessly between moments of erratic intensity, tender romanticism, and unabashed sensuality. With sculptural lighting and costuming, and an ensemble of dancers moving as one powerful organism, Carmina Burana becomes more than performance - it becomes like ritual.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>What emerges is a celebration of the human spirit in all its complexity: raw passion, vulnerability, desire, and joy. It’s a work that demands everything of its dancers and leaves audiences exhilarated, moved, and inspired - proving why it remains a standout in the RWB’s repertoire.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Choreography: Mauricio Wainrot<span><br/></span>Music: Carl Orff, Carmina Burana<span><br/></span>Set & Costume Design: Carlos Gallardo<span><br/></span>Lighting Design: David Morrison<span><br/></span>Associate Lighting Design: Robert Mravnik<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">T’əl: The Wild Man of the Woods</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">“T’əl is a powerful fusion of Indigenous storytelling, contemporary ballet, and classical music - rooted in tradition and elevated for the stage.” - The Globe and Mail</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>T’əl: The Wild Man of the Woods marks a bold new chapter in the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s repertoire. Choreographed by RWB School alumnus, choreographer Cameron Fraser-Monroe, this West Coast première unfolds an Indigenous legend through the lens of a fully Indigenous creative team.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Narrated in both English and Ayajuthem by Elder Elsie Paul, the story follows a fearless young woman who sets out to rescue her sister from T’əl, a dark figure who steals children under the cover of night.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The evocative original score is composed by Cris Derksen, a JUNO-nominated, Two-Spirit cellist and composer. With stunning costume design by Asa Benally (Navajo designer and Yale alumnus), T’əl is a powerful fusion of movement, music, and storytelling that honours the richness of oral tradition.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Choreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe<span><br/></span>Oral History Storyteller: Elder Elsie Paul<span><br/></span>Composer: Cris Derksen, Featuring Northern Voice Recording as well as Sheldon & Frazer Sundown<span><br/></span>Costume Design: Asa Benally<span><br/></span>Lighting Design: Scott Henderson<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Cameron Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla'amin First Nation, located on British Columbia’s Sunshine Coast. He grew up in Vernon, British Columbia, where he began his dance training in Ukrainian dance at the age of three. At 15, he moved to Winnipeg to attend the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School, marking the beginning of his professional ballet journey</span>

	Every few millennia, a comic emerges, born from the cosmic soup of fate and time, jostled by the gales of change onto the unpredictable shores of comedic brilliance.

As Derek says: In the grand contest of life, he stands proudly as a bona fide \"participant.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Well...truth be told, there’s a lot more to it than that. From Vegas to St. John's, this Just For Laughs veteran is universally considered to be among the comic elite. Certainly his peers think so, as evidenced by the fact that he's a four-time nominee, and winner of Best Standup Comic - Canadian Comedy Awards, as well as a multiple Gemini nominee for Best Performance in a Comedy.

	Tonye Aganaba is a Black African queer, disabled and non-binary immigrant and uninvited settler living on the unceded ancestral territories of the Musqueam, Squamish & Tsleil-Waututh First Nations. They were born in London, England - the belly of the beast and the stronghold of imperialism, colonialism and racial capitalism, and immigrated to so-called Canada at the age of 13. They proudly trace their ancestral line to the lands known today as Nigeria and Zimbabwe.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tonye is an interdisciplinary artist and musician - and their style is dynamic and fluid - weaving playful threads of Soul, Neo-Folk, Funk, Hip-Hop and R&B. Their shows, gatherings, and workshops are connected and intimate experiences, and evoke a kind of vulnerability that we all hunger for. They are a steadfast fixture in their local arts community - and a passionate and political being.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When they’re not on stage or in the studio - they’re actively unlearning and re-learning as a community worker and organizer working in solidarity with oppressed peoples and in defense of the planet, in an effort to decolonize body, mind, spirit and space. You can find them organizing with Defund 604 Network, Community Accountability Project, Ethos Lab, and Cops Out Of Schools - four collectives based in so-called Vancouver that are dedicated to creating safe and healthy spaces for all.

Their harmonies were so tight that every group wanted to emulate them. Before that there was a singer, a band and backing vocals, The Everly’s entwined all of them and created ‘the harmony group’.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Walk Right Back is the first show of its kind to tell this phenomenal story of two brothers and their unforgettable music.

	<span class=\"BoldText\">An Axis Theatre Production</span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">By Tai Amy Grauman</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">A Métis love-story that transcends time to safeguard history.</span></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>From acclaimed Vancouver-based youth theatre company Axis Theatre comes <span class=\"ItalicText\">Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</span>, a love story through the ages. Two star people and a Buffalo, fall to earth and continue to reconnect throughout history. The play covers seven different periods of Métis history. We bear witness to the emergence of the Métis nations across the plains, the robust colonization that arises from the fur trade, the disappearance of the buffalo and the political uprising of the Métis Association of Alberta. The story begins during creation amongst the stars and ends in the present day.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</span> specifically shares scenarios from the Callihoo family’s stories, incorporating fiddle music, jigging and a life-like buffalo puppet. Inspired by historical events of the Métis people of Canada, this original play for young audiences explores the loves, the losses and the fight of Treaty 6’s Métis people – and their love and kinship to the buffalo.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">CONTENT ADVISORY</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The characters in <span class=\"ItalicText\">Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</span> depict scenes that would have happened in Métis history. And there are several marriage proposals! These historical actions include:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>1830: Marie is skinning a rabbit with a knife. She also shoots a buffalo with a rifle. The buffalo dies and is cut up by Marie.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>1885: Louis has a musket in silhouette, we hear gunshots (a depiction of the battle of Batoche).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>1925: Marie and Louis run away from residential school and ascend to the stars (they die).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The musket and the knife are stage props and are representative of the time in history, the situation, are used to tell the story.
