Russell. The quartet was so pleased to work with him and share his engagingly creative musical voice with the Kingston community, that they agreed to premiere a new quartet by him in the future. This concert will bring this project to realization with the premiere performance of his latest quartet that was commissioned with funding provided by the Ontario Arts Council.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This concert opens with a work Amy Beach who is often acclaimed as the first successful American female composer. Beach’s lyrical gifts and exquisite craft, can heard in her THEME AND VARIATIONS, presented by the quartet and DAN School flute professor, Sarah Moon. Schubert’s DEATH AND THE MAIDEN QUARTET, one of the towering achievements in chamber music, concludes the evening.

  schema:description """
	This contrasting concert program is inspired by war and peace. Persichetti’s manuscript sketches show that <span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">Pageant</span></span> was first entitled <span class=\"ItalicText\">Morning Music for Band</span>. The opening horn motive and the first theme in the clarinet choir have a serene, pastoral quality that evokes thoughts of sunrise. The composer utilizes polytonality with multiple key centers shifting from a peaceful introduction to a lively parade with military percussion support. When Frank Ticheli is asked to describe <span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">Sanctuary</span></span>, one of his finest pieces, he mentions <span class=\"ItalicText\">“The word sanctuary conjures a rich array of images. It can imply a place of solitude, comfort, rest, prayer, protection. It can suggest a place that is strong and imposing or one that is very small and private. The opening bell sounds suggest peace and joyful reverence. The main horn melody is at once reflective and reassuring.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span> <span class=\"ItalicText\"><span class=\"BoldText\">Letters for Home</span></span> by Peter Meechan is a three-movement work in commemoration of the start of the First World War. It follows an unfortunately typical story of a soldier in the war through its movements: <span class=\"ItalicText\">A Bittersweet Love Song, In the Trenches, and In Memory</span>. Jan Van der Roost’s work Spartacus, subtitled symphonic tone poem un omaggio a Ottorino Respighi, recalls the life and death of the Roman gladiator Spartacus, who led a slave revolt in 73 B.C. that was the last and most important of the Servile Wars. The oriental quality of the melodic fragments refers to the origin of the Roman slaves. Modern composition techniques such as 12 tones series are used throughout the symphonic poem. The piece navigates between a romantic and peaceful nature to an aggressive and martial spirit referring to the revolt of the slaves. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Queen’s University Wind Ensemble, directed by Dan Tremblay, is open to all members of the University community by audition. The Wind Ensemble usually meets twice a week and performs two times a year. In past years, conjunct concerts with other high-calibre Canadian wind ensembles and conductors were encouraged. Past collaborations included performances with the McGill Wind Symphony (Alain Cazes), Western University (Colleen Richardson), UofT (Gillian MacKay), and the Central Band of the Canadian Forces (Capt. Fullerton). The Wind Ensemble is performing a repertoire of classic, contemporary, and newly composed music.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

Queen’s students also get the opportunity to arrange music for this ensemble and conduct the ensemble. This term, our concert features arrangements by Olivia Budgell, BMus ’24, as well as music by Bach, Faure and Chopin arranged by Rosalynn Heuer and Joan Harrison.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Multi-Genre Vocal Ensemble will most beautifully and musically remind you that, alas, the only thing constant is change! Turn the World Around is a program of songs about cycles and seasons, with repertoire ranging from Philip Glass to Paul Simon, Harry Belafonte to Anaïs Mitchell. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Clarinet Choir will present excerpts from Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker Suite arranged by Ian Deterling. Ian Deterling is a composer of aesthetically intriguing works for varied instrumentation. Blending tradition with contemporary practice, his music engages audiences by being authentic, relevant, and memorable. Deterling’s works have been performed nationally and internationally, most notably by members of prestigious organizations such as the London Symphony Orchestra, the São Paulo State Symphony, the National Symphony Orchestra of Taiwan, and the San Antonio Symphony. His works and arrangements for educational ensembles are frequently performed at high schools and colleges as well as by amateur community bands, orchestras, and ensembles all around the world.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Queen’s Percussion Ensemble presents “Shared Space”: Melodic post-minimalist music for percussion. The program includes Starfall by James Vilseck which reflects a sense of wonder one has while staring up into the sky and appreciating the beauty of the stars.  Porcupine by Keith Stratton uses a variety of instruments (including marimba and vibraphone, glockenspiel, various drums, claves and shakers) to present a slightly prickly but ultimately charming piece with an endearingly lopsided groove. Shell by Emma O’Halloran was inspired by the work of photojournalist Seph Lawless who has traveled across the United States capturing images of abandoned shopping malls. There’s a certain feeling evoked<span><br/></span>from places that should be full of people but are now empty and decaying. Before online shopping, these were vibrant communal places, now the emptiness is amplified. This will be the Canadian Premiere of Shell. Shared Space by Ivan Trevino was commissioned by McCallum High School Percussion Ensemble for<span><br/></span>their 2015 PASIC showcase concert. The piece is scored for seven percussionists who share a setup of one 5.0 octave marimba, one vibraphone, one glockenspiel, one cajón, and two concert toms. At times, up to five players perform on the same keyboard instrument, some standing on the opposite side of the instrument, creating a challenging and fun learning and performing experience.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

Up to two free student tickets can be ordered online using the discount code: <span class=\"BoldText\">STUDENTFREE</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The performers for this concert have written of their excitement in presenting this concert as follows:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The combination of two pianists and two percussionists is rare, and understandably so. It’s not easy to find two beautiful grand pianos, an impressive set-up of percussion instruments, and enough space to house them all at once– let alone four players who are into the idea. The fact that it’s rare is ironic, considering how often pianists and percussionists collaborate with others. In particular, pianists and percussionists usually collaborate with instruments that produce sound entirely differently. Those instruments – strings, winds, brass – draw a bow or blow a stream of air to create sound, while the pianist and percussionist deal in a note’s first point of contact. They sustain, we attack.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>And that’s why this type of collaboration is so utterly impressive and fun: we’re all of the same ilk when it comes to making noise. We all hit, attack, even create the illusion of sustaining a long phrase– and we do it with a unique sound world that can’t be mistaken for any other kind of chamber ensemble.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Our program celebrates this sound world. Tobin Stokes’ EL SOL DEL SUR (THE SUN OF THE SOUTH) is full of heat, radiating from sunny chord clusters and agile rhythms interwoven between the four of us. Béla Bartók’s SONATA FOR TWO PIANOS AND PERCUSSION is one of his most-performed works. He nods to sonata form, yet fills it with experimental sounds and leans hard into atonality, tritones everywhere, and upended rhythms. THE BLUE GUITAR, composed and arranged for our ensemble by our own Jamie Drake, was inspired by Wallace Stevens’ 1937 poem, THE MAN WITH THE BLUE GUITAR, which was in turn inspired by Picasso’s 1903 painting, THE OLD GUITARIST. Drake’s folk-like, modal sound complements the text: “Things as they are/ Are changed upon the blue guitar.”<span><br/></span>
