All concerts are free and open to the public.<span><br/></span>Register your attendance in advance to receive a reminder about the concerts!</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We are pleased to welcome Eric Friessen, well-known former CBC host and performing arts commentator, to serve as moderator for the semi-finals and finals rounds of the competition. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The vision for the 2026 competition draws from the Isabel’s 2025-2026 season theme of “Extending the Rafters,” invoking the Haudenosaunee tradition of building good relations. Inspired by this theme, we are exploring ways piano competitions can be diversified with respect to Indigenization – Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Anti-Black Racism, and Accessibility.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The 2026 competition includes a newly commissioned work by acclaimed Indigenous composer, Cris Derksen. In the Final Round pianists create their own program with works that may include the pianist’s own composition, a work by a BIPOC composer, and/or a work by a woman Canadian composer.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In addition, two special prizes have been established for the preliminary round: 1) most outstanding performance of a work by a BIPOC composer; and 2) most outstanding performance of a work by a woman composer. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“The Isabel is excited about promoting this expanded frame of the competition and the potential for an immediate ongoing impact on audiences and talented emerging pianists. It is our intention that `Extending the Rafters’ in these ways will help to open up new pathways of inclusion at the same time as sustaining the highest standards of performance excellence.” (Gordon E. Smith, Director, Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts).   <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The 2026 Bader & Overton Canadian Piano Competition has been made possible through the generosity of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.queensu.ca/theisabel/rent-isabel/ballytobin-foundation\">Bader Philanthropies, Inc.</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information about the competition, including details about the jury, repertoire and how to apply to compete, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.queensu.ca/theisabel/about-isabel/competitions/bader-overton-competitions\">click here</a>. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2>Wednesday May 6</h2><table class=\" BorderOn\">

	Conceived for two exceptional musicians—Aiyun Huang, percussionist, and Mark Fewer, violinist—this project examines how clocks respond to one another, to the passage of time, to stress, and to emotions. The two instruments embody distinct yet complementary temporalities, symbolizing the diversity of human experiences.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Each scene is an exploration of a key theme: memory, stress, love, and the irreversibility of time. The violin and percussion become mirrors of the human soul: fragile, complex, deeply connected.
