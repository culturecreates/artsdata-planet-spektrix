  schema:name "2024-25 An Evening with Danny Michel and Steve Poltz";
  schema:description """
	Two of the most brilliant and engaging musicians in North America team up for a very special concert of songs and stories. Expect an evening of superb musicianship, spontaneous hilarity, and joyful exuberance.<span><br/></span>Steve Poltz is not normal. He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia but has lived most of his life in Southern California and those geographic poles are quite likely responsible for this unhinged genius. He is a dual citizen but has often said that \"should a hostage situation arise, I become conveniently Canadian.\" He is known for his spectacularly inventive live shows and owns a crowd when he's on stage. He can take an unsuspecting audience from laughter to tears and back again in the space of a single song. He is a master of improvisational songwriting and works without a set list to be free to react in the moment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Danny Michel has long been a headliner at concert halls and festivals across Canada. He too has recorded over twelve albums and his compelling live shows, thoughtful lyrics and charming stage presence have earned a devoted fan base, multiple nominations for Junos, The Polaris Prize, CBC's \"Heart of Gold\", and the CFMA's \"Producer of the Year\" and \"Oliver Schroer Pushing the Boundaries\" Awards. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On Danny Michel: \"Just fabulous. He's kind of like Paul Simon in the Rhymin' Simon Days\" - Stuart MacLean, CBC Radio<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Presented by: Rankin Productions

  schema:description """
	The 2025 Royal Society of Canada Eastern Ontario Symposium is a free event open to anyone from the Kingston community and beyond, interested in hearing four experts talk entertainingly about their research. There will be a short period for questions following each presentation. Tickets are required and can be obtained in advance from the Isabel Box Office (up to two tickets per order). Seating is assigned so getting tickets early will ensure a good seat. The cash bar will open at 12:30 PM. This event will be available for livestream viewing using the link on this page. The video can also be viewed during the following week on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.isabeldigitalconcerthall.queensu.ca/live-streams\">Isabel Digital Concert Hall</a>.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In presenting this event, support is gratefully acknowledged from the Royal Society of Canada, Queen’s Vice-Principal Research Portfolio, and the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">RICHARD J. BATHURST—Finally, a good news story for plastics? Modern geosynthetics in geotechnical applications</span> <span><br/></span>Richard Bathurst, Professor Emeritus of Civil Engineering at the Royal Military College of Canada, is also cross appointed with the Civil Engineering Department at Queen's University. His presentation will trace the trajectory of using geosynthetics in the civil engineering earthworks landscape over the past 50 years. Unlike the bad-news stories that are often connected to the use of plastics, this is a good-news story because these materials are durable and long-lasting without damaging the environment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">CATHLEEN CRUDDEN—The power of organometallics: From catalysts to self-assembled monolayers to atomically precise nanoclusters</span> <span><br/></span>Cathleen Crudden is the Allie Vi Douglas Distinguished University professor in the Department of Chemistry at Queen’s University. She is also the Scientific Director of the Carbon to Metal Coating Institute. Research at this institute focuses on using N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to address current challenges from microelectronics, to metal corrosion, to cancer targeting and therapeutics. This presentation will describe the modification of metallic surfaces with NHCs in many areas, including NHC-stabilized clusters in biological studies and in catalysis.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">AMY LATIMER-CHEUNG—Learning to prioritize quality over quantity: Lessons from research partnerships</span>  <span><br/></span>Dr. Latimer-Cheung is a Professor in the School of Kinesiology and Health Studies at Queen’s University and is the Director and Principal Investigator leading the Canadian Disability Participation Project 2.0. In this presentation, she will reflect personally on how her research focus has shifted over the years from developing recommendations for the optimal dose of exercise for persons with disabilities, to emphasizing the quality of physical activity participation for persons with disabilities. In pursuing this emphasis on quality academic outputs combined with implications for the quantity of participation, she has formed invaluable partnerships with colleagues and research users. As she will explain, in refocussing of her personal research mission, Dr. Latimer-Cheung's work not only makes an empirical contribution but most importantly, makes an impact in real-world settings.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">JOHN SMOL: Forgotten lakes — Braiding indigenous knowledge with lake sediment archives</span> <span><br/></span>John P. Smol is a Distinguished University Professor at Queen’s University in the Department of Biology where he founded and co-directs the Paleoecological Environmental Assessment and Research Lab (PEARL). Long-term environmental data are lacking for most lakes. While we can’t go back in time and directly monitor these “forgotten lakes”, we can reconstruct missing data sets with lake sediment analyses (i.e. paleolimnology). Additionally, his lab’s retrospective “western science” approach shares many similarities to Indigenous Traditional Knowledge, where a key focus often includes “looking backwards” for historical information on local ecosystems. This presentation will show how working alongside Indigenous knowledge holders is providing critical data, at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, for evidence-based remediation efforts and the ongoing negotiations regarding reconciliation.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information on each speaker, their presentation and their research, please visit the Royal Society of Canada <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rsc-src.ca/en/events/2025-royal-society-canada-eastern-ontario-symposium\"> webpage here</a>.<span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	The act of writing is not a stream of words; it is a path to power— the power to stimulate, to provoke and change. Through more than 50 books, Margaret Atwood has proved the power of words to spark global conversations about dystopian futures, women's rights, environments at risk. Just one of her novels, <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Handmaid's Tale</span>, remains emblematic of resistance against authoritarianism forty years after publication. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Famous for her acute, sometimes acerbic, observations, Margaret Atwood takes the Isabel stage for a profound, witty, and far-seeking conversation with award-winning novelist and poet Ian Williams, author of the 2024 Massey Lectures, <span class=\"ItalicText\">What I Mean to Say: Remaking Conversation in our Time</span>. Based on talks delivered across Canada last fall, Ian explores what makes a good conversation; how to connect with those you oppose; and when to use silence as a conversational gambit. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Kingston WritersFest 2025 takes its theme from Margaret Atwood herself: A Word After a Word After a Word is Power. What forged Canada's most notorious and beloved writer? She claims she isn't a seer, but her books are eerily prescient: what lies ahead for her, for us? <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Join us for this Kingston WritersFest fundraiser that celebrates the author who launched the first WritersFest in 2009 and who, sixteen years later, is sparking its revival.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This event is sponsored by Professional Investments (Kingston) Inc.<span><br/></span>This event is also supported by The Ballytobin Foundation and The Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts

	Conceived for two exceptional musicians—Aiyun Huang, percussionist, and Mark Fewer, violinist—this project examines how clocks respond to one another, to the passage of time, to stress, and to emotions. The two instruments embody distinct yet complementary temporalities, symbolizing the diversity of human experiences.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Each scene is an exploration of a key theme: memory, stress, love, and the irreversibility of time. The violin and percussion become mirrors of the human soul: fragile, complex, deeply connected. Through their musical dialogue, they offer an artistic meditation on temporality, love, and what makes us beings in a perpetual quest for synchronization with the world.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please Note: Only tickets purchased directly from the Isabel Box Office or the Isabel Website will be valid for performances presented by the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts.

The concerts are in support of Joe's Mill Instrument Lending Library, Blue<span><br/></span>Canoe Productions and Childhaven. Children and youth from Blue Canoe will be on stage with us taking the lead in a few songs. Wait til' you hear an eight year old hammer out Selena Ryder's 'Stompa' with a 6 piece band and 110 back up singers!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tickets are limited and this is pretty well guaranteed to be a sell out. You don't want to be<span><br/></span>hearing how great it was, when you could be there! <span><br/></span>Tickets through the Isabel Bader Center for the Performing Arts and <span><br/></span>Supported by: The Ballytobin Foundation<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>*Our tickets are regularly priced at $25.00+hst (plus $2.50 service charge) and a discretionary price of $7.50+hst (plus $2.50 service charge) for those 12 and under, or those who feel unable to pay full price at this time.

  schema:description """
	<h2>Training the Early Modern Heart </h2><h2>A conference presented by Department of English, Queen’s University</h2>Music has a powerful natural capacity to affect human beings in immediate and profound ways–to move us to tears of grief or smiles of joy.  Since the Ancients, the affective powers of song have preoccupied thinkers; Plato, for example, wrote that \"rhythm and harmony permeate the inner part of the soul more than anything else, affecting it most strongly.\"  Even today, some of the most cutting-edge neuroscience is devoted to uncovering the internal rhythms of our brains and of our bodies, and to explaining how external music can resonate with those internal rhythms. But for Reformation Christians, the question of how music and poetry might affect the soul of an auditor held unique currency; the fracturing of the Roman Church in the sixteenth century left Protestants and Catholics alike in fierce competition to win the hearts and minds of parishioners, and music, it was believed by many, could do just that.  Music, it was said, had the capacity to enter an auditor through their ears and penetrate their heart, potentially operating as a means of grace.  In this intimate concert of seventeenth-century songs for the heart, audiences will be invited to open their own hearts to the sounds of grief and joy that express our common human experiences.  The concert will feature internationally renowned baritone Jonathon Adams and will include well-loved classics such as Henry Purcell's setting of George Herbert's lyric, \"With Sick and Famished Eyes\" alongside newly-discovered and rarely-heard gems from the archives by John Jenkins and Henry Lawes.  Come, and let us pluck on your heart strings, while we endeavour to tune our own through song.
