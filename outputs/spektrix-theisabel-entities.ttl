Marsalis formed his own quartet in 1986 and it remains his primary performance vehicle.

His work on Broadway has garnered a Drama Desk Award and Tony nominations.

	Two of the most brilliant and engaging musicians in North America team up for a very special concert of songs and stories. Expect an evening of superb musicianship, spontaneous hilarity, and joyful exuberance.<span><br/></span>Steve Poltz is not normal. He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia but has lived most of his life in Southern California and those geographic poles are quite likely responsible for this unhinged genius. He is a dual citizen but has often said that \"should a hostage situation arise, I become conveniently Canadian.\" He is known for his spectacularly inventive live shows and owns a crowd when he's on stage. He can take an unsuspecting audience from laughter to tears and back again in the space of a single song. He is a master of improvisational songwriting and works without a set list to be free to react in the moment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Danny Michel has long been a headliner at concert halls and festivals across Canada. He too has recorded over twelve albums and his compelling live shows, thoughtful lyrics and charming stage presence have earned a devoted fan base, multiple nominations for Junos, The Polaris Prize, CBC's \"Heart of Gold\", and the CFMA's \"Producer of the Year\" and \"Oliver Schroer Pushing the Boundaries\" Awards. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On Danny Michel: \"Just fabulous. He's kind of like Paul Simon in the Rhymin' Simon Days\" - Stuart MacLean, CBC Radio<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Presented by: Rankin Productions

	This concert is inspired by the human and divine nature, landscapes, tradition, and architecture. This year, we are celebrating the 150th birthday of one of the most important and influential composers for wind ensemble, Gustav Holst. In this concert, the Queen’s University Wind Ensemble will interpret his First Suite in E flat for Military Band, the cornerstone of twentieth century band repertoire.

Angels in the Architecture is based on the dramatic conflict between the two extremes of human existence – one divine, the other evil. This accomplished and inspired composition by Frank Ticheli features a variety of contrasting styles, such as a peaceful vocalist accompanied by a colourful assortment of percussion instruments. Angels will<span><br/></span>certainly resonate well in the beautiful acoustics of the Isabel Performance Hall.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Queen’s University Wind Ensemble, directed by Dan Tremblay, is open to all members of the university community, by audition. The Wind Ensemble usually meets twice a week and performs twice a year. In past years, joint concerts with other high-calibre Canadian wind ensembles and conductors were encouraged. Past collaborations included performances with the McGill Wind Symphony (Alain Cazes), Western University (Colleen Richardson), U of T (Gillian MacKay), and the Central Band of the Canadian Forces (Capt. Fullerton). The Wind Ensemble is performing a repertoire of classic, contemporary, and newly composed music.

  schema:name "2024-25 Queen's Wind Ensemble - Winds of Revelations, Reflections, and Contemplations 2025";
  schema:description """
	This concert is a celebration of Gustav Holst and Alfred Reed, two of the most important composers for Wind Ensemble. The music selected is a combination of festive works and compositions inspired by the human and divine nature and spiritual quest. This program is in continuation of the celebration of the 150th birthday of one of the most important and influential composers for wind ensemble, Gustav Holst. The Queen’s University Wind Ensemble will interpret A Somerset Rhapsody in Holst's honour; a beautiful complex work less often performed. From his energetic overture The Music-Makers to the entertaining five folk songs included in Armenian Dances, Alfred Reed revels his incomparable orchestration talent when composing for winds and percussions. Contemplation & Awakening from Reed’s Revelations from the Lotus Sutra is a masterpiece that should be interpreted more regularly. The Lotus Sutra from Mahayana Buddhism of East Asia is the teaching of human respect, self-perfection, and world peace – in a word, humanism. This humanistic principle leads mankind from division to unity, from discord to harmony, and from conflict to peace. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Queen’s University Wind Ensemble, directed by Dan Tremblay, is open to all members of the university community by audition. The Wind Ensemble usually meets twice a week and performs two times a year. In past years, conjunct concerts with other high-calibre Canadian wind ensembles and conductors were encouraged. Past collaborations included performances with the McGill Wind Symphony (Alain Cazes), Western University (Colleen Richardson), UofT (Gillian MacKay), and the Central Band of the Canadian Forces (Capt. Fullerton). The Wind Ensemble is performing a repertoire of classic, contemporary, and newly composed music.

	The Wilderness is what you get when six chosen brothers from Kingston, ON spend nine years driving 100,000 miles for nothing but the love of rock n' roll. Sometimes, you get songs like therapy sessions, oversharing to strangers about your weird relationship with your dad and how you thought you'd be young forever. Other times, you get your mum's favourite would-be arena band crammed into your hometown's sweatiest dive bar on a Tuesday night with rent due in the morning. No matter what, you get the hardest-working, harmony-belting, saxophone-growling, cowboy-chord-strumming, tambourine throwing small-town rock n' roll band your friends have probably never heard of, in it for the long haul from 2015- forever<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Texas King:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Texas King is a high-energy alternative rock band blending rock, indie, and pop influences with explosive live performances. Their EPs Changes (2022) and Capsize (2023) showcased their evolving sound, including the #4 Active Rock hit \"Whatever You Break\". They’ve just released their highly anticipated album Ultraviolet on February 21, 2024, led by the single “Hook Me Up”, a raw reflection on embracing change. Having toured across North America, playing major festivals and sharing the stage with Big Wreck, Last Dinosaurs, and The Glorious Sons, Texas King continues to push boundaries in alternative rock. Stay tuned for new music and tour dates.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>VIP tickets available for early access to the venue, as well as a special, intimate, acoustic performance before the show!

  schema:description """
	To see and hear Kingston indie rock outfit Tiny Horse—led by guitarists and vocalists Ciara Roberts and Rae Corcoran—is to step into a place of possibility and freedom. Their performances are equal parts small-town queer cabaret, ‘70s folk-rock rapture, and Bowie-ish extravaganza. Their music crackles with John Prine’s rich storytelling and winking humor, Patti Smith’s punkish abandon and revelry, and Haim and Taylor Swift’s melodic brilliance.

  schema:description """
	Featuring Bartok’s monumental SONATA FOR TWO PIANOS AND PERCUSSION, DAN School pianists, Clare Marion and Jenna Simeonov, join forces with DAN School Professor of Percussion, Jamie Drake, and Montreal percussionist, Brydone Charlton. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>FREE STUDENT TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW: The DAN School invites all youth to celebrate the arts with our $6 and $8 student tickets. New for this year, with the support of the George Taylor Richardson Memorial Fund, the DAN School is removing further barriers by offering free student tickets to each 2024/25 DAN School Faculty Artist Series concert. Up to two free student tickets can be ordered online using the discount code: STUDENTFREE<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The performers for this concert have written of their excitement in presenting this concert as follows:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The combination of two pianists and two percussionists is rare, and understandably so. It’s not easy to find two beautiful grand pianos, an impressive set-up of percussion instruments, and enough space to house them all at once– let alone four players who are into the idea. The fact that it’s rare is ironic, considering how often pianists and percussionists collaborate with others. In particular, pianists and percussionists usually collaborate with instruments that produce sound entirely differently. Those instruments – strings, winds, brass – draw a bow or blow a stream of air to create sound, while the pianist and percussionist deal in a note’s first point of contact. They sustain, we attack.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>And that’s why this type of collaboration is so utterly impressive and fun: we’re all of the same ilk when it comes to making noise. We all hit, attack, even create the illusion of sustaining a long phrase– and we do it with a unique sound world that can’t be mistaken for any other kind of chamber ensemble.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Our program celebrates this sound world. Tobin Stokes’ EL SOL DEL SUR (THE SUN OF THE SOUTH) is full of heat, radiating from sunny chord clusters and agile rhythms interwoven between the four of us. Béla Bartók’s SONATA FOR TWO PIANOS AND PERCUSSION is one of his most-performed works. He nods to sonata form, yet fills it with experimental sounds and leans hard into atonality, tritones everywhere, and upended rhythms. THE BLUE GUITAR, composed and arranged for our ensemble by our own Jamie Drake, was inspired by Wallace Stevens’ 1937 poem, THE MAN WITH THE BLUE GUITAR, which was in turn inspired by Picasso’s 1903 painting, THE OLD GUITARIST. Drake’s folk-like, modal sound complements the text: “Things as they are/ Are changed upon the blue guitar.”<span><br/></span>

Unlike the bad-news stories that are often connected to the use of plastics, this is a good-news story because these materials are durable and long-lasting without damaging the environment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">CATHLEEN CRUDDEN—The power of organometallics: From catalysts to self-assembled monolayers to atomically precise nanoclusters</span> <span><br/></span>Cathleen Crudden is the Allie Vi Douglas Distinguished University professor in the Department of Chemistry at Queen’s University. She is also the Scientific Director of the Carbon to Metal Coating Institute. Research at this institute focuses on using N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to address current challenges from microelectronics, to metal corrosion, to cancer targeting and therapeutics. This presentation will describe the modification of metallic surfaces with NHCs in many areas, including NHC-stabilized clusters in biological studies and in catalysis.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">AMY LATIMER-CHEUNG—Learning to prioritize quality over quantity: Lessons from research partnerships</span>  <span><br/></span>Dr. Latimer-Cheung is a Professor in the School of Kinesiology and Health Studies at Queen’s University and is the Director and Principal Investigator leading the Canadian Disability Participation Project 2.0. In this presentation, she will reflect personally on how her research focus has shifted over the years from developing recommendations for the optimal dose of exercise for persons with disabilities, to emphasizing the quality of physical activity participation for persons with disabilities. In pursuing this emphasis on quality academic outputs combined with implications for the quantity of participation, she has formed invaluable partnerships with colleagues and research users. As she will explain, in refocussing of her personal research mission, Dr. Latimer-Cheung's work not only makes an empirical contribution but most importantly, makes an impact in real-world settings.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">JOHN SMOL: Forgotten lakes — Braiding indigenous knowledge with lake sediment archives</span> <span><br/></span>John P. Smol is a Distinguished University Professor at Queen’s University in the Department of Biology where he founded and co-directs the Paleoecological Environmental Assessment and Research Lab (PEARL). Long-term environmental data are lacking for most lakes. While we can’t go back in time and directly monitor these “forgotten lakes”, we can reconstruct missing data sets with lake sediment analyses (i.e. paleolimnology). Additionally, his lab’s retrospective “western science” approach shares many similarities to Indigenous Traditional Knowledge, where a key focus often includes “looking backwards” for historical information on local ecosystems. This presentation will show how working alongside Indigenous knowledge holders is providing critical data, at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, for evidence-based remediation efforts and the ongoing negotiations regarding reconciliation.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information on each speaker, their presentation and their research, please visit the Royal Society of Canada <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rsc-src.ca/en/events/2025-royal-society-canada-eastern-ontario-symposium\"> webpage here</a>.<span><br/></span>

	The act of writing is not a stream of words; it is a path to power— the power to stimulate, to provoke and change. Through more than 50 books, Margaret Atwood has proved the power of words to spark global conversations about dystopian futures, women's rights, environments at risk. Just one of her novels, <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Handmaid's Tale</span>, remains emblematic of resistance against authoritarianism forty years after publication. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Famous for her acute, sometimes acerbic, observations, Margaret Atwood takes the Isabel stage for a profound, witty, and far-seeking conversation with award-winning novelist and poet Ian Williams, author of the 2024 Massey Lectures, <span class=\"ItalicText\">What I Mean to Say: Remaking Conversation in our Time</span>. Based on talks delivered across Canada last fall, Ian explores what makes a good conversation; how to connect with those you oppose; and when to use silence as a conversational gambit. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Kingston WritersFest 2025 takes its theme from Margaret Atwood herself: A Word After a Word After a Word is Power. What forged Canada's most notorious and beloved writer? She claims she isn't a seer, but her books are eerily prescient: what lies ahead for her, for us? <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Join us for this Kingston WritersFest fundraiser that celebrates the author who launched the first WritersFest in 2009 and who, sixteen years later, is sparking its revival.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This event is sponsored by Professional Investments (Kingston) Inc.<span><br/></span>This event is also supported by The Ballytobin Foundation and The Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts

	Our Carmen is a newcomer to Canada, a feisty little girl, facing her first day in a Canadian school. She loves to dance, and sing, and she is not to be tamed. When Tory Adair, the “coolest kid in school” tries to bully her, she stands up to him. And gets in a whole lot of trouble. Through her story we look at the outsider in Canadian society, the child who is different, schoolyard bullying, the value of independence, and the saving properties of art. With Bizet’s bewitching, infectious music, Carmen’s flamenco dancing, and the action-packed story, <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Schoolyard Carmen</span> has proved to be Shoestring’s most popular adaptation yet!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Estimated runtime: 45 mins, followed by Q&A.  No intermission.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please Note: Only tickets purchased directly from the Isabel Box Office or the Isabel Website will be valid for performances presented by the Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts.

  schema:description """
	<h2>Training the Early Modern Heart </h2><h2>A conference presented by Department of English, Queen’s University</h2>Music has a powerful natural capacity to affect human beings in immediate and profound ways–to move us to tears of grief or smiles of joy.  Since the Ancients, the affective powers of song have preoccupied thinkers; Plato, for example, wrote that \"rhythm and harmony permeate the inner part of the soul more than anything else, affecting it most strongly.\"  Even today, some of the most cutting-edge neuroscience is devoted to uncovering the internal rhythms of our brains and of our bodies, and to explaining how external music can resonate with those internal rhythms. But for Reformation Christians, the question of how music and poetry might affect the soul of an auditor held unique currency; the fracturing of the Roman Church in the sixteenth century left Protestants and Catholics alike in fierce competition to win the hearts and minds of parishioners, and music, it was believed by many, could do just that.  Music, it was said, had the capacity to enter an auditor through their ears and penetrate their heart, potentially operating as a means of grace.  In this intimate concert of seventeenth-century songs for the heart, audiences will be invited to open their own hearts to the sounds of grief and joy that express our common human experiences.  The concert will feature internationally renowned baritone Jonathon Adams and will include well-loved classics such as Henry Purcell's setting of George Herbert's lyric, \"With Sick and Famished Eyes\" alongside newly-discovered and rarely-heard gems from the archives by John Jenkins and Henry Lawes.  Come, and let us pluck on your heart strings, while we endeavour to tune our own through song.
