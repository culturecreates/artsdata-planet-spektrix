Le rock 60s / 70s et les ballades 80s de La 4ième dimension (version longue) suivent en 2016, puis la pop / disco 70s de Boîte aux lettres en 2020. Un quatrième album, Tintamarre, celui-ci inspiré du roots rock des jukeboxes louisianais, est paru en octobre 2024. Changements de cap toujours, donc - ce qui fait autant la marque du groupe que son entrain indéfectible et son intérêt pour l’actualisation des sons passés.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Première partie : Will Pacaud</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Will Pacaud est un guitariste franco-yukonnais âgé de 16 ans. Inspiré dès son enfance par ses proches musiciens, il est repéré par Roxx Hunter et monte pour la première fois sur scène au Sourdough Rendezvous en 2019. C’est après ce spectacle qu’apparaît le Will Pacaud Band, composé principalement de Will et Roxx. Le jeune musicien jongle entre les styles rock, reggae et blues, tout en alternant entre acoustique et électrique. En plus de son travail en groupe, il poursuit une carrière solo pour présenter ses propres compositions originales.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">The Hay Babies – Tintamarre</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As part of Coup de Cœur Francophone 2025, the Association Franco-Yukonnaise (AFY) is proud to present The Hay Babies’ show, Tintamarre! <span><br/></span>The evening will open with Will Pacaud as the opening act.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Description</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Les Hay Babies are friends first: fun comes before work and work is done while having fun. New Brunswick-born Acadians Julie Aubé, Katrine Noël and Vivianne Roy have been bringing forth their sparkling, multifaceted folk-rock for over a decade, renewing their musical proposition with each new release. Since forming a band in 2011, they have launched their EP Folio (2012) and the albums<span class=\"BoldText\"> Mon homesick heart</span> (2014), La 4ième dimension (version longue) (2016), and Boîte aux lettres (2020), shifting from indie-folk and country to classic rock and disco. They reinvent their sound once again with their fourth album, to come out in 2024: a trademark of theirs as much as their unwavering drive and interest in actualizing sounds from past decades.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Opening Act: Will Pacaud</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Will Pacaud is a 16-year-old Franco-Yukoner guitarist. Inspired from an early age by his family of musicians, he was discovered by Roxx Hunter and performed on stage for the first time at the Sourdough Rendezvous in 2019. Following that performance, the Will Pacaud Band was formed, featuring Will and Roxx as its core members. The young musician moves seamlessly between rock, reggae, and blues, switching from acoustic to electric. Alongside his band work, he is developing a solo career to showcase his own original compositions.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>L’Association franco-yukonnaise remercie ses bailleurs de fonds, Coup de cœur francophone et leurs partenaires pour leur appui essentiel à la réalisation de cet événement. / The Association franco-yukonnaise thanks its funders, Coup de cœur francophone, and their partners for their essential support in making this event possible.<span><br/></span>•	Gouvernement du Yukon<span><br/></span>•	Gouvernement du Canada<span><br/></span>•	Lotteries Yukon<span><br/></span>•	Jazz Yukon<span><br/></span>•	Northern Vision Developpement<span><br/></span>•	MusicAction<span><br/></span>•	SiriusXM<span><br/></span>•	UnisTV<span><br/></span>•	Radio-Canada<span><br/></span>•	Gouvernement du Québec<span><br/></span>•	Socan<span><br/></span>•	Akufen<span><br/></span>

	<h1><span class=\"BoldText\">YTYP GALA</span> </h1><h1><span class=\"BoldText\">FROZEN THE MUSICAL</span></h1><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Join us for the opening night gala performance of Disney’s Frozen, which will include a glamorous evening of frozen cocktails and treats and exclusive photos with the cast and a backstage tour.  From “Arendelle Ice” cocktails to snowflake-shaped desserts dusted in edible glitter. Guests are encouraged to embrace the spirit of the show through elegant winter attire and a touch of icy glamour. The gala culminates in our YTYP’s opening night performance of Disney’s Frozen - the Musical — a true celebration of friendship, courage, and the magic of letting go.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For the first time in forever, experience the musical phenomenon that has taken the world by storm! Based on the Academy Award-winning animated feature film, Disney’s Frozen includes all the film’s beloved songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, along with new music written exclusively for the stage.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the beautiful mountainous kingdom of Arendelle, Princesses Anna and Elsa grow up sheltered inside their castle, isolated from the world and increasingly distant from each other. When Elsa is crowned queen, the magical powers she’s desperately tried to conceal from her sister take control, and she flees into the mountains. As a ferocious winter descends on Arendelle, Anna sets off on an epic journey to find Elsa and bring her home – with the help of hardworking ice harvester Kristoff, his loyal reindeer Sven, and a happy-go-lucky snowman named Olaf.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Full of magic, humor, and a stunning musical score, Frozen is a powerful tale of sisterhood, acceptance, and finding the real meaning of true love – performed by Yukon young people ages 9-24.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Suitable for all audiences.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Presented with permission of Music Theatre International.</span><span><br/></span>
