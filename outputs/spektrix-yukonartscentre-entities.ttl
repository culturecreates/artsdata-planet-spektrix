  schema:description """
	Join us for an evening with David Garneau in conversation with Ivan Coyote, presented in conjunction with Garneau’s solo exhibition Dark Chapters. Together, they will explore themes of artmaking, his Métis identity, and storytelling. This talk offers a deeper entry into Garneau’s practice as a painter, writer, and curator, and the ideas animating Dark Chapters. A co-presentation with Yukon University.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Bio: David Garneau (Métis) is a Professor of Visual Arts at the University of Regina. He is a painter, curator, and writer who engages creative and critical expressions of Indigenous contemporary ways of knowing, being, and doing.

Garneau has curated more than two dozen exhibitions in Canada and internationally (including the Museum of the American Indian, NYC). He has given keynotes in Australia, New Zealand, and throughout Canada on re/conciliation, museums, Indigenous contemporary and public art. His performance, Dear John, featuring the spirit of Louis Riel meeting with John A. Macdonald statues, was presented in Regina, Kingston, and Ottawa. David recently installed a large public art work, the Tawatina Bridge paintings, in Edmonton and designed the Riel Commemorative Silver Dollar for the Canadian Mint. His painting exhibition, Dark Chapters tours Canada in 2025-8.

	Join Cryptozoologists with special guests the Bleeders at the Old Fire Hall for an evening celebrating the band's new album, Backwater Station. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Backwater Station is Cryptozoologists at their most honed and confident, a culmination of a decade of irreverent and angst-fueled songwriting in Whitehorse’s fast-changing social landscape. As contrast to the romanticization of Whitehorse as the unblemished, so-called “wilderness city,” the album’s nine songs centre elements of the left-behind, the unremarkable, and the undesired of the urban public sphere - the city’s undeveloped gravel lots, its puke averted on the sidewalk, and the route of its human waste to the municipal sewage lagoon.

	Ritter is a renowned singer, songwriter, musician, artist and best-selling author. One of today’s most thoughtful and prolific voices, he has released eleven studio albums including 2019’s widely acclaimed, Fever Breaks, of which NPR Music praised, “He remains a hydrant of ideas while embodying an endless capacity for empathy and indignation, often within a single song.”<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>In addition to his work as a musician, Ritter is also a national best-selling author, having released two novels to date: 2021’s The Great Glorious Goddamn of It All and 2011’s Bright’s Passage.

The result is an emotional, autobiographical soundtrack where each song is associated with a loved one or an intimate story. Acclaimed by audiences and critics alike, Inuktitut is the artist's second album to land a shortlist nomination for the Polaris Music Prize.

	<h1><span class=\"BoldText\">YTYP GALA</span> </h1><h1><span class=\"BoldText\">FROZEN THE MUSICAL</span></h1><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Join us for the opening night gala performance of Disney’s Frozen, which will include a glamorous evening of frozen cocktails and treats and exclusive photos with the cast and a backstage tour.  From “Arendelle Ice” cocktails to snowflake-shaped desserts dusted in edible glitter. Guests are encouraged to embrace the spirit of the show through elegant winter attire and a touch of icy glamour. The gala culminates in our YTYP’s opening night performance of Disney’s Frozen - the Musical — a true celebration of friendship, courage, and the magic of letting go.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For the first time in forever, experience the musical phenomenon that has taken the world by storm! Based on the Academy Award-winning animated feature film, Disney’s Frozen includes all the film’s beloved songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, along with new music written exclusively for the stage.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In the beautiful mountainous kingdom of Arendelle, Princesses Anna and Elsa grow up sheltered inside their castle, isolated from the world and increasingly distant from each other. When Elsa is crowned queen, the magical powers she’s desperately tried to conceal from her sister take control, and she flees into the mountains. As a ferocious winter descends on Arendelle, Anna sets off on an epic journey to find Elsa and bring her home – with the help of hardworking ice harvester Kristoff, his loyal reindeer Sven, and a happy-go-lucky snowman named Olaf.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Full of magic, humor, and a stunning musical score, Frozen is a powerful tale of sisterhood, acceptance, and finding the real meaning of true love – performed by Yukon young people ages 9-24.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Suitable for all audiences.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"ItalicText\">Presented with permission of Music Theatre International.</span><span><br/></span>
