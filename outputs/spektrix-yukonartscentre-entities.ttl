In 2022, she released The Sargasso Season, an original collection of songs written on the traditional 21-stringed Chinese zither. The album is an exploration of sounds and possibilities on the versatile instrument, and seeks out a place for the guzheng in Canadian folk-roots music. Exclaim! Magazine named her one of the \"must-hear\" emerging artists in Canada, and she was featured on CBC Music alongside artists like the Polaris Music Prize finalists, Pantayo, who are incorporating Asian heritage into their music. Erica often performs with her husband, Darcy McCord, a classically trained cellist, and together they create a unique orchestral folk sound. Paper Wealth is Erica Dee Mah’s second offering of original guzheng music and was released in May 2024. Incorporating many traditional sounds and techniques on the Chinese zither, “Paper Wealth” is a vibrant and layered collection of songs that celebrates Chinese-Canadian cultural heritage. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Paper Wealth is available via Bandcamp, and major streaming platforms: <span><br/></span>http://www.ericamah.com<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Christopher Tse is an educator and award-winning writer based in Whitehorse, Yukon.

He has shared the stage with Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, Shane Koyczan, and Mustafa the Poet, and his work has appeared on stages, radio, and graffiti walls worldwide. He teaches social work at the University of Victoria. A Song for the Paper Children is Christopher's first book. The poem was written to commemorate the centenary of the Chinese Exclusion Act, and was performed by Christopher Tse in the Senate of Canada on 23 June 2023.

  schema:description """
	From the Great Northern Plains, Little Miss Higgins struts and serenades her way onto any stage playing music brewed up in early country blues, jazz and folk.  For over 20 years, she has performed, toured, collaborated, recorded and released seven independent albums. Her music and artwork have received many accolades, awards and nominations including Western Canadian Music Awards, JUNOs and Maple Blues Awards.  <span><br/></span>Little Miss Higgins (aka Jolene Higgins) was born in Brooks, Alberta, and raised in Independence, Kansas.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Music entered her life early. “When I was about four my dad brought home an old mini-grand piano and told me it was mine.  I carved my name in the side of it and, it was inevitable, I had to start taking piano lessons.” Higgins now uses guitar and voice as her main instruments as well as her theatre background to bring a refreshing sound and story to the stage. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Her most recent projects are exactly a culmination of these two worlds–music and theatre. Released in 2021, The Fire Waltz is a 5-part music driven radio play podcast. And, the latest endeavor, One For Sorrow, Two For Joy, is a theatre piece using music and puppetry to tell the fictional story of a woman who lives alone on the prairies in the early 1900’s. Higgins not only co-wrote the story and composed music for the show, but has also taken on a role as a puppeteer for live performances. She incorporates songs from both projects into her music show.<span><br/></span>

Within MOI, one character’s interactions are only with inanimate objects.

Our social bonds allow us to understand that we have an impact on what is around us – that we exist.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Research began on MOI in 2018 after Artistic Director Shay Kuebler read about the “Minister of Loneliness” in the UK.

Meet Diane, a permaculture gardener dripping with butch lesbian charm. She’s got supernatural abilities owing to her true identity - the Greek god Dionysus- and she’s returned to the modern world to gather mortal followers and restore the Earth to its natural state.

It explores the songs people turn to when they’re sad, the songs that they play to soothe their blues or lift them up out of the depths. Jane sings and tells stories about songs that play this role in her own life, and then invites the audience to share the songs that they sing (or play or listen to) when they’re sad. It’s a rare opportunity to hear a superb singer up close and personal as she delves into the link between deep emotions and the musical elements that make sad songs so addictive. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Created by Jane Miller & Brian Quirt.<span><br/></span>Performed by Jane Miller. <span><br/></span>Directed & dramaturged by Brian Quirt. <span><br/></span>Produced by Gloria Mok. <span><br/></span>Designed by Rebecca Picherack. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Playlists of sad songs generated by the audience in recent performances can be listened to via <a href=\"https://nightswimming.ca\">https://nightswimming.ca</a><span><br/></span> and playlists from each of the <a href=\"https://nightswimming.ca/sad-songs-playlists-whitehorse/\">Whitehorse performances</a> will be available the following day.
