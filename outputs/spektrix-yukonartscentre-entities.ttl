  schema:description """
	<span class=\"ItalicText\">Our Lady of the Home</span> recounts the story of Liza, a housewife of the 1960’s who finds herself troubled by her reality. Perceiving this unease as a mental imbalance -rather than a healthy reaction to oppressive circumstances- she contacts her doctor and begins to take a new and fashionable medication. Liza’s transformation unfolds through scenes both sincerely human and vividly surreal, as she reaches towards the light of her personal truth.  Through a vocabulary of contortion, acrobatics, theatre, and Aerial Hoop, performer Alyssa Bunce invites the audience to witness the inmost room of Liza’s reality.  “Our Lady of the Home” contrives a captivating, comedic and moving reflection on identity, mental health, and self-reclamation: unpacking the stigma of \"hysteria\" and celebrating Liza's courage to choose Herself.    <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>[<span class=\"BoldText\">Duration</span> 65 minutes. <span class=\"BoldText\">Note:</span> This show references themes of substance use & mental health which may be sensitive for some individuals.]

	Sarah Harmer is a multiple award-winning, platinum-selling singer-songwriter and environmental activist. Her solo music career launched with the now classic debut You Were Here (2000) and includes six critically acclaimed albums, including her latest, Are You Gone, released via Arts & Crafts.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A deeply personal and political collection of songs motivated by the beauty of life, the urgency of the climate crisis, and the question of loss, Sarah called the album a spiritual successor of sorts to her acclaimed 2000 debut. Its simple title, Are You Gone, is a meditation on presence and a bookend to the questions posed on You Were Here - a sharpened, more electric confrontation with the realities of nature and human nature.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Between co-founding the citizen’s organization PERL (Protecting Escarpment Rural Land) and leading the successful effort to prevent an open-pit gravel mine in a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve on the Niagara Escarpment, Sarah has become a fixture in local politics and advocacy. In 2022, Sarah helped launch the Reform Gravel Mining Coalition in her home province of Ontario to protect water, farmland, and biodiversity. She is currently writing songs for a new album.<span><br/></span>

This contemporary dance work looks at isolation and togetherness through tumultuous times and asks the question, “How can we hold both hope and inspiration while moving through grief?”.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Way of the Wind tells the story of a group of women struggling with their own fears, frustrations and hardships. Throughout the piece, they learn to share their stories, lean on each other, and ultimately harness their collective power and strength. WOW is about self, community, and teamwork; as well as female softness and strength. It is about instigating change, about momentum in movement - both physical and societal. WOW demonstrates through dance that by harnessing our collective power, we can organise to create change.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The creation of this new work is led by Michaëla St-Pierre and is created with dancers Valérie Herdes, Grace Simpson-Fowler, and Sadie Segriff. The score is composed by local musicians Calla Paleczny, Evan Stepanian, Victoria Parker, and Kelvin Smoler.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This cathartic work is made for all audiences and will transport us through a moving journey on stage that pushes the limits of creativity in contemporary dance, sound design and lighting.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>-<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Way of the Wind (WOW) raconte l’histoire d’un groupe de femmes, toutes bouleversées par la tristesse et les frustrations vécues dans leur isolement. Au cours du spectacle, elles apprennent à partager leur histoire, et leur chagrin se radoucit au fur et à mesure qu'elles partagent le pois de ce qu’elles portaient toutes seules. Les femmes apprennent à s'écouter, à s'entraider, et à travailler en équipe, et en prenant des tours à mener et à suivre, elles créent un élan qui les transporte à travers un orage qu'elles vivent sur scène.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>WOW célèbre la douceur et les pouvoirs féminins. Elle démontre par la danse que, en s’unissant, on peut insuffler de l’élan pour créer des changements dans notre société.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>-<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Note:</span> If you are unable to use your purchased tickets the evening of the performance, please consider calling the box office so we can assign the seat(s) to a member of the public on the waitlist.
