Parents Maria and Nik, along with their four children, embrace self-sufficiency and home-schooling, and strive to live in total harmony with nature. To make ends meet, Maria occasionally works as a photographer, capturing her family and surroundings in photos and stories shared on her blog, “Wild + Free.” But their world turns upside down when tragedy strikes, and Maria suddenly passes away. Nik must sell the farm, give up his independent lifestyle and reluctantly return to civilization in order to raise his children. “But Mom will come with us,” the kids assure him, and Maria’s photos and stories, present throughout the film, maintain her memory as a constant presence and narrator. A New Kind of Wilderness is a universal story about life choices and responsibilities, a blueprint for living and loving, and a touching message about climate crisis and sustainability through the loss of a mother and Mother Nature.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In Norwegian and English with English subtitles.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Content advisory: themes of death.

MIKE LEIGH, 2024, GBR/ESP | 97 MIN<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Legendary filmmaker Mike Leigh returns to the contemporary world with a fierce, compassionate, and often darkly humorous study of family and the thorny ties that bind us. Reunited with Leigh for the first time since multiple Oscar-nominated Secrets and Lies, the astonishing Marianne Jean-Baptiste plays Pansy, a woman wracked by fear, tormented by afflictions, and prone to raging tirades against her husband, son, and anyone who looks her way. Meanwhile, her easygoing younger sister, played by Michele Austin (Another Year), is a single mother with a life as different from Pansy’s as their clashing temperaments - brimming with communal warmth from her salon clients and daughters alike. This expansive film from a master dramatist takes us into the intensities of kinship, duty, and the most enduring of human mysteries: that even through lifetimes of hurt and hardship, we still find ways to love those we call family.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Content advisory: coarse language throughout.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>recommended ages 15+ <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Genre: Drama/Comedy<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">@Yukon Arts Centre</span>

	<h1><span class=\"BoldText\">THE STAND</span></h1><span><br/></span>DIR. CHRISTOPHER AUCHTER, 2024, BRITISH COLUMBIA | 94 MIN<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>On a misty morning in the fall of 1985, a small group of Haida people blockaded a muddy dirt road on Lyell Island (then known as the Queen Charlotte Islands).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>After a century of colonialist rule, Haida culture was nearly obliterated, with language and traditions fading, and the land stripped of its resources. But a committed group of Haida and their supporters took a stand, demanding a stop to clear-cut logging practices that had destroyed salmon habitat and ravaged old-growth forest. In the face of overwhelming pressure from the RCMP, private logging interests and even the media, the defenders called for the government to work with Indigenous people to find a way to protect the land and the future.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In a riveting new feature documentary drawn from more than a hundred hours of archival footage and audio, award-winning director Christopher Auchter (Now Is the Time) recreates the courage, tenacity and tension of this critical turning point. From furious showdowns between television pundit Jack Webster and Haida leader Miles Richardson, to the support of then-NDP MLA Svend Robinson, The Stand captures the struggle as it unfolds on a moment-to-moment basis.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Genre: Documentary<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">@Yukon Arts Centre</span>

	Alex Cuba is a Grammy and Juno-winning singer, songwriter, producer, and musician. Born Alexis Puentes in Artemisa, Cuba, he now resides in Smithers, BC, Canada. His first musical memory was playing claves (a Cuban rhythm instrument) at the age of 4 alongside his father on national TV. He went on to study guitar, then electric and upright bass, touring and recording nationally and internationally, before moving to Canada in 1999. His sound is a unique confluence of tradition and global influences, conveyed through articulate arrangements that express emotions through melody and lyric.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2022, he won a Grammy for Best Latin Pop for “Mendó” as producer, artist, and engineer, his proudest accomplishment among the 20+ awards and nominations he has received as an independent artist over 9 albums. His musical evolution has been about seeking the simplicity and soul of Cuban music—distilling complex arrangements, blending North American influences, embracing the melodic simplicity of pop, and drawing inspiration from Cuban folk traditions. He’s always exploring, creating something fresh and new, and, it seems, getting it just right.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“I always believed, from the beginning of my career in Canada, that if music is beautiful, it will cross the language.
