  schema:name "Frankenstein";
  schema:description """
	If you see one Netflix release on the big screen this year, Frankenstein is the one... except, well, there's Train Dreams. We're presenting that in-cinema as well.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro’s visually sumptuous adaptation of Mary Shelley’s gothic masterpiece finds Oscar Isaac as the brilliant scientist whose unearthly creation, eerily and ingeniously conjured by Jacob Elordi, blurs the boundaries between life, death, and madness.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, and the Oscar-winning The Shape of Water transformed what monsters mean to us, steeping their outsider narratives in deep emotion and grand tragedy. But the pinnacle on Guillermo del Toro’s horizon was always Mary Shelley's gothic masterpiece from 1818. Now it is here.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Oscar Isaac plays Victor Frankenstein, a brilliant scientist tortured by ambition and his own raging passions. Pushing his work beyond scientific certainty to the boundary between life and death, he brings a new being into existence in a spectacular moment of creation. Played in completely original fashion by Jacob Elordi, Frankenstein's monster begins as a powerful, dangerous beast but carries the equally dangerous capacity to learn from human behaviour. It puts Frankenstein and his family in jeopardy — he's strikingly concerned for his brother's fiancé, Elizabeth (Mia Goth).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Having spent most of his life absorbing and distilling the Frankenstein story and all its lore, del Toro takes liberties with the novel. The result is a singular vision that could only have come from cinema’s master of the monstrous.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Shot at a vast studio in Toronto and on location in Scotland, Frankenstein is a marvel of filmmaking craft rarely seen anymore. Tamara Deverell’s production design is both intricate and staggering. The colours, patterns, and textures of Kate Hawley’s costumes, especially for Goth's character, add layers of meaning to the story. Even with the boundless reach of its fantasy, much of the film was made with real sets and other practical means, rather than digital effects.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Frankenstein is del Toro's magnum opus, the story of a brilliant creator driven to the brink of madness, and a creation who meets him there.\" - Cameron Bailey, TIFF<span><br/></span>Recommended ages 15+ for accident trauma, coarse language, sexual language, frightening scenes, scenes of surgery and violence.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dir Guillermo del Toro<span><br/></span>•  Released 2025<span><br/></span>•  Origin Canada, United States, Mexico<span><br/></span>•  Duration 149 minutes <span><br/></span>•  Genre Drama, Horror<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

Acadiennes d’origine néo-brunswickoise, Julie Aubé, Katrine Noël et Vivianne Roy avancent leur folk-rock pluriel et pétillant depuis plus d’une décennie, renouvelant leur proposition musicale à chaque parution. Découvertes via l’EP indie-folk / country Folio en 2012, elles rappliquent deux ans plus tard avec Mon homesickheart en 2014, un premier album aux sonorités folk-rock contemporaines. Le rock 60s / 70s et les ballades 80s de La 4ième dimension (version longue) suivent en 2016, puis la pop / disco 70s de Boîte aux lettres en 2020. Un quatrième album, Tintamarre, celui-ci inspiré du roots rock des jukeboxes louisianais, est paru en octobre 2024. Changements de cap toujours, donc - ce qui fait autant la marque du groupe que son entrain indéfectible et son intérêt pour l’actualisation des sons passés.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Première partie : Will Pacaud</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Will Pacaud est un guitariste franco-yukonnais âgé de 16 ans. Inspiré dès son enfance par ses proches musiciens, il est repéré par Roxx Hunter et monte pour la première fois sur scène au Sourdough Rendezvous en 2019. C’est après ce spectacle qu’apparaît le Will Pacaud Band, composé principalement de Will et Roxx. Le jeune musicien jongle entre les styles rock, reggae et blues, tout en alternant entre acoustique et électrique. En plus de son travail en groupe, il poursuit une carrière solo pour présenter ses propres compositions originales.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">The Hay Babies – Tintamarre</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As part of Coup de Cœur Francophone 2025, the Association Franco-Yukonnaise (AFY) is proud to present The Hay Babies’ show, Tintamarre! <span><br/></span>The evening will open with Will Pacaud as the opening act.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Description</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Les Hay Babies are friends first: fun comes before work and work is done while having fun. New Brunswick-born Acadians Julie Aubé, Katrine Noël and Vivianne Roy have been bringing forth their sparkling, multifaceted folk-rock for over a decade, renewing their musical proposition with each new release. Since forming a band in 2011, they have launched their EP Folio (2012) and the albums<span class=\"BoldText\"> Mon homesick heart</span> (2014), La 4ième dimension (version longue) (2016), and Boîte aux lettres (2020), shifting from indie-folk and country to classic rock and disco. They reinvent their sound once again with their fourth album, to come out in 2024: a trademark of theirs as much as their unwavering drive and interest in actualizing sounds from past decades.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Opening Act: Will Pacaud</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Will Pacaud is a 16-year-old Franco-Yukoner guitarist. Inspired from an early age by his family of musicians, he was discovered by Roxx Hunter and performed on stage for the first time at the Sourdough Rendezvous in 2019. Following that performance, the Will Pacaud Band was formed, featuring Will and Roxx as its core members. The young musician moves seamlessly between rock, reggae, and blues, switching from acoustic to electric. Alongside his band work, he is developing a solo career to showcase his own original compositions.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>L’Association franco-yukonnaise remercie ses bailleurs de fonds, Coup de cœur francophone et leurs partenaires pour leur appui essentiel à la réalisation de cet événement. / The Association franco-yukonnaise thanks its funders, Coup de cœur francophone, and their partners for their essential support in making this event possible.<span><br/></span>•	Gouvernement du Yukon<span><br/></span>•	Gouvernement du Canada<span><br/></span>•	Lotteries Yukon<span><br/></span>•	Jazz Yukon<span><br/></span>•	Northern Vision Developpement<span><br/></span>•	MusicAction<span><br/></span>•	SiriusXM<span><br/></span>•	UnisTV<span><br/></span>•	Radio-Canada<span><br/></span>•	Gouvernement du Québec<span><br/></span>•	Socan<span><br/></span>•	Akufen<span><br/></span>
