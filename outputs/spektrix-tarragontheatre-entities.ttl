	<h1>Oleanna</h1><h2>By David Mamet</h2><span><br/></span>Produced by Icarus Theatre, to learn more visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icarustheatre.ca\">www.icarustheatre.ca</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>One of the most celebrated and controversial plays of our generation, Oleanna explores the fallout of an explosive series of conversations between a female student and her male college professor. From the team that brought you last year’s hit production of Constellations, this play brilliantly examines power, structure, and how we decide what the ‘truth’ is.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Audience Advisories: Oleanna includes loud sounds, fluorescent lighting, depictions of physical violence, and depictions of sexual harassment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We use a tiered-PWYC (Pay What You Can) system to offer accessibly-priced tickets to everyone! Buying a $36 or $66 PWYC ticket is an excellent way to support Icarus Theatre in our first three-show season, and help us continue to make thrilling indie theatre.
