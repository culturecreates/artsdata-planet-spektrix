From the team that brought you last year’s hit production of Constellations, this play brilliantly examines power, structure, and how we decide what the ‘truth’ is.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Audience Advisories: Oleanna includes loud sounds, fluorescent lighting, depictions of physical violence, and depictions of sexual harassment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We use a tiered-PWYC (Pay What You Can) system to offer accessibly-priced tickets to everyone! Buying a $36 or $66 PWYC ticket is an excellent way to support Icarus Theatre in our first three-show season, and help us continue to make thrilling indie theatre.
