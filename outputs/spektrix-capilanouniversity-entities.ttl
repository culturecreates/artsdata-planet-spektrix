  schema:description """
	Senegalese griot Ablaye Cissoko and French multi-instrumentalist Cyrille Brotto take audiences on an intimate journey, melding the deep traditions of their very different musical cultures while showcasing music’s ability to expand traditions and connect individuals. Cissoko’s delicate voice and kora combined with the brilliant sound of Brotto’s diatonic accordion create a remarkably warm and graceful music that fuses West African Mandingo culture, French traditional music, jazz, and classical music. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Since the release of his first album in 2003, Ablaye Cissok has established himself as one of the best kora players and also as a man of encounters, recording sometimes with the German trumpeter Volker Goetze, sometimes with the Canadian ensemble Constantinople or with the group African Jazz Roots. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Cyrille Brotto is a virtuosic diatonic accordionist and multi-instrumentalist, who adds a European flair to the collaboration. His distinguished career in performance and education spans across Europe, contributing to the dynamic fusion of cultural influences that characterizes this unique musical partnership. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The duo followed up their 2022 debut <span class=\"ItalicText\">Instant</span>, with the extraordinary <span class=\"ItalicText\">Djiyo</span> in January of this year. “Masterful... a gem from start to finish.” <span class=\"ItalicText\">Songlines</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.capilanou.ca/student-services/community/blueshore-financial-centre-for-the-performing-arts/our-events/all-events/events/ablaye-cissoko-and-cyrille-brotto.php\">Show Info</a></h2><span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	<h1>The Music of Kenny Wheeler Featuring Jennifer Scott, Brad Turner and CapU Jazz Ensembles</h1><span><br/></span>Internationally acclaimed Canadian trumpeter and composer Kenny Wheeler left an indelible mark on the jazz world with his uniquely lyrical, harmonically adventurous music. BlueShore at CapU proudly pays tribute to Wheeler’s remarkable legacy with a performance of his most iconic works. The evening stars Brad Turner on trumpet and vocalist/pianist Jennifer Scott, accompanied by CapU Jazz Ensembles.  <span><br/></span>Turner, one of Vancouver’s most celebrated jazz trumpeters, is known for his brilliant technique and emotive performances. Also a pianist, drummer and composer, Turner has released 10 albums, plus another six with multiple Juno Award-winning group Metalwood. Vancouver-based Jennifer Scott has released four acclaimed albums and played sold-out concerts across Canada and the US. Scott brings “a striking emotional intelligence to everything she sings, no matter what the context,” says Jazz Times. The two musicians—both revered faculty members of the CapU Jazz Studies program—bring their extraordinary artistry to Wheeler’s deeply personal compositions, creating a perfect homage to this legendary figure in jazz. <span><br/></span>This concert is a rare opportunity to experience the genius of Kenny Wheeler through the lens of two of Canada’s finest jazz musicians backed by a big band comprised of exciting, fresh talents of CapU Jazz Studies. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.capilanou.ca/student-services/community/blueshore-financial-centre-for-the-performing-arts/our-events/all-events/events/the-music-of-kenny-wheeler-featuring-jennifer-scott-and-brad-turner.php\">Show Info</a>

	Two esteemed Vancouver-based ensembles, musica intima and Triology, blend together colours and textures of classical vocal music and instrumental jazz for this extraordinary presentation. After releasing a recording of Maria Schneider’s Grammy Award-winning song cycle “Winter Morning Walks” in 2021, the two groups, with multiple Junos nominations between them, are debuting an entire concert of music together.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Arranged by BC jazz legend (and former CapU faculty treasure) Rejean Marois, “Winter Morning Walks” will be presented alongside jazz and a cappella arrangements of favourite seasonal music, creating an unforgettable holiday concert.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>About the nine short poems of “Winter Morning Walks,” by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ted Kooser, Schneider writes, “His metaphors...illuminate the depth of feeling I’ve always felt for the prairie country... These poems, set in Midwest winter landscapes, moving from the winter solstice to the vernal equinox, feel like home to me and became a natural inspiration for my own musical voice.” Schneider’s immaculate settings result in an uplifting, timeless ode to the human condition that will leave audiences glowing with the transcendent power of art in the darkest time of year.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Triology is a supergroup of three award-winning Canadian jazz musicians –Jodi Proznick on bass, Miles Black on piano and Bill Coon on guitar. They have shared the stage with Lewis Nash, Ed Thigpen, Clark Terry, Max Roach and others. For this show, Triology will be joined by Montréal-based drummer Mili Hong.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Founded in 1992, musica intima is renowned for championing Canadian music on stages around the world.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.capilanou.ca/student-services/community/blueshore-financial-centre-for-the-performing-arts/our-events/all-events/events/winter-morning-walks-musica-intima--triology.php\">Show Info</a></h2>
