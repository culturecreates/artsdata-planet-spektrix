	Senegalese griot Ablaye Cissoko and French multi-instrumentalist Cyrille Brotto take audiences on an intimate journey, melding the deep traditions of their very different musical cultures while showcasing music‚Äôs ability to expand traditions and connect individuals. Cissoko‚Äôs delicate voice and kora combined with the brilliant sound of Brotto‚Äôs diatonic accordion create a remarkably warm and graceful music that fuses West African Mandingo culture, French traditional music, jazz, and classical music. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Since the release of his first album in 2003, Ablaye Cissok has established himself as one of the best kora players and also as a man of encounters, recording sometimes with the German trumpeter Volker Goetze, sometimes with the Canadian ensemble Constantinople or with the group African Jazz Roots. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Cyrille Brotto is a virtuosic diatonic accordionist and multi-instrumentalist, who adds a European flair to the collaboration. His distinguished career in performance and education spans across Europe, contributing to the dynamic fusion of cultural influences that characterizes this unique musical partnership. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The duo followed up their 2022 debut <span class=\"ItalicText\">Instant</span>, with the extraordinary <span class=\"ItalicText\">Djiyo</span> in January of this year. ‚ÄúMasterful... a gem from start to finish.‚Äù <span class=\"ItalicText\">Songlines</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.capilanou.ca/student-services/community/blueshore-financial-centre-for-the-performing-arts/our-events/all-events/events/ablaye-cissoko-and-cyrille-brotto.php\">Show Info</a></h2>

	<h2>Gord Grdina's Ru'ya takes place at Christ Church Cathedral</h2><span><br/></span>Ru‚Äôya‚Äîwhich means ‚Äúforesight‚Äù or ‚Äúvision‚Äù in Arabic‚Äîis an ensemble that brings together diverse musical traditions, led by Vancouver-based guitarist and oud player Gord Grdina, with vocalist Ghalia Benali (Belgium/Tunisia), pianist Elias Stemeseder (U.S.), violinist Eylem Basaldi (T√ºrkiye/U.S.), percussionist Hamin Honari (Canada), and drummer Christian Lillinger (Germany).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ru‚Äôya is the culmination of 20 years of musical exploration that started with Grdina‚Äôs debut album, <span class=\"ItalicText\">Think Like the Waves</span>, recorded with Gary Peacock and Paul Motian. This led to projects examining the edges of tonality and including elements of Persian classical music and Arabic maqam. This new program uses an inclusive focus while creating space for each of these incredible musicians to freely express themselves in their unique voices.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The concept is taken further in collaboration with Ghalia Benali‚Äôs idea of poets as the true chroniclers of human history, capturing emotional truths, love, longing, trauma, and memory. This work transforms poetic texts into universal artistic forms, proving that the deeper we dig into our roots, the more we resonate with others. By aligning differences, we discover shared emotions and end up speaking the same language, one of humanity, connection, and beauty.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ru‚Äôya demonstrates ways music and poetry can transcend borders and blend seamlessly with diverse contemporary artistic expression while we honour our origins.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.capilanou.ca/student-services/community/blueshore-financial-centre-for-the-performing-arts/our-events/all-events/events/gord-grdinas-ruya-.php\">Show Info</a></h2><span><br/></span><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thecathedral.ca/programs/plan-your-visit\">Christ Church Cathedral Parking Info</a></h2><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

	Two esteemed Vancouver-based ensembles, musica intima and Triology, blend together colours and textures of classical vocal music and instrumental jazz for this extraordinary presentation. After releasing a recording of Maria Schneider‚Äôs Grammy Award-winning song cycle ‚ÄúWinter Morning Walks‚Äù in 2021, the two groups, with multiple Junos nominations between them, are debuting an entire concert of music together.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Arranged by BC jazz legend (and former CapU faculty treasure) Rejean Marois, ‚ÄúWinter Morning Walks‚Äù will be presented alongside jazz and a cappella arrangements of favourite seasonal music, creating an unforgettable holiday concert.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>About the nine short poems of ‚ÄúWinter Morning Walks,‚Äù by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ted Kooser, Schneider writes, ‚ÄúHis metaphors...illuminate the depth of feeling I‚Äôve always felt for the prairie country... These poems, set in Midwest winter landscapes, moving from the winter solstice to the vernal equinox, feel like home to me and became a natural inspiration for my own musical voice.‚Äù Schneider‚Äôs immaculate settings result in an uplifting, timeless ode to the human condition that will leave audiences glowing with the transcendent power of art in the darkest time of year.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Triology is a supergroup of three award-winning Canadian jazz musicians ‚ÄìJodi Proznick on bass, Miles Black on piano and Bill Coon on guitar. They have shared the stage with Lewis Nash, Ed Thigpen, Clark Terry, Max Roach and others.
