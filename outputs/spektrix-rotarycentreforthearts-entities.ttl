	Fiery and luscious Celtic music with a two-time BC fiddle champion Michael Burnyeat and an accordion wizard Kosta Bozhinov.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Michael Burnyeat<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Michael Burnyeat is a fiddler and multi-instrumentalist from Vancouver, BC, who plays with numerous Celtic, Folk, and Country bands in Vancouver and across the lower mainland. He led the well known Jericho Folk Club sessions for many years, is the founder of the UBC Fiddle Club, and is a two-time BC fiddle champion (2017-2018).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2018 and 2019 he was a finalist in the Canadian Grandmasters Fiddle Competition, the most prestigious fiddle contest in Canada. In 2018 he released his first album of fiddle music, entitled A Sense of Tradition, which Folk World magazine listed as one of the best traditional albums of the year. He currently is also an in demand music instructor in Vancouver.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Kosta Bozhinov<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"I'm Kosta Bozhinov and I'm a classically-trained folk musician, teacher, and researcher. I play the guitar, lute, accordion, piano, and organ. Originally from Dobrich, Bulgaria, I've lived in Vancouver, Canada, since 2006. Music based on improvisation and an aural tradition has always resonated with me more than anything else. While I was raised with Balkan folk music, the Celtic traditional repertoire has become a major part of what I do.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>I studied music in Douglas College, the University of British Columbia, and McGill University. In 2018, I completed a PhD in musicology from the University of Victoria. As a researcher, I take a Darwinian approach to musicology and am interested in the development of music as part of bio-cultural evolution.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Some performance highlights include concerts with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, the Victoria Symphony Orchestra, the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Pacific Opera Victoria, the Vancouver Bach choir, the Pacific Baroque Orchestra, the Kensington Sinfonia, and the Sidney Classical Orchestra.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As a recording artist, I've recorded soundtracks for movies and best-selling video games. Most recently, I released my first solo album, a collection of popular Celtic tunes, titled The Road Goes On. I also launched Made Up Records, a record label devoted to folk and world music.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	The Rotary Centre for the Arts presents Alex Cuba in the Mary Irwin Theatre. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Touring in support of his eighth studio album, Mendó which is an afro Cuban word meaning substance of the soul. Music as it best accompanies us in our life transitions and helps process emotions in ways our science has yet to understand. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Though raised in Artemisa, an hour outside of Havana, Alex Cuba’s artistry is as far-flung as the place he has settled and lived for over fifteen years: Smithers, BC, 14 hours north of Vancouver. His music at once incorporates his roots and is a unique amalgam of styles, having collaborated with artists ranging from Jason Mraz to Ron Sexsmith and Nelly Furtado; and bringing together melodies, popsoul hooks and rock chords in songs that may seem to bear little resemblance to traditional Cuban form. A forward-thinking, indie-minded artist, Alex has amassed a steadily growing following among critics and fans. With over 20 awards and nominations to his name, including four Latin Grammys and two Junos Awards and three Grammy nominations. Alex carries his Cuba within, incorporating subtle jazz influences, gained from his early years as a bass player in Cuba, and tasteful, sophisticated chords andlyrics expressing his poetry in an undeniably Cuban way. His growing body of work defines a unique musical place in the Latin diaspora.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Find out more and listen at: www.alexcuba.com<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please be advised that, in accordance with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www2.gov.bc.ca/vaccinecard.html\">current provincial health orders</a>, the Rotary Centre for the Arts will be increasing the capacity of Alex Cuba Live in Concert from 50 patrons to 50% of the total seating of the Mary Irwin Theatre (163 patrons). This increase is contingent on all patrons over 12 years of age demonstrating proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 at the point of entry.<span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	UPDATE (Jan. 18, 2022): Due to complications related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, RCA Presents Blackie and the Rodeo Kings will be postponed. Information regarding new dates will be forthcoming shortly. We sincerely apologize for any disappointment and inconvenience this change may cause, and extend our thanks to all our patrons for their patience as we do everything we can to respond to changing provincial health orders. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The pandemic emerged as Blackie and The Rodeo Kings marked their 25th anniversary as a band with the release of <span class=\"ItalicText\">King of This Town</span>. They plan to pick up right where they left off, writing and releasing more music and hitting the performance stage as often as possible.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Originally, Colin Linden, Stephen Fearing and Tom Wilson came together to record what was supposed to be a one-off tribute album to the great Canadian songwriter Willie P. Bennett. The result was <span class=\"ItalicText\">High or Hurtin’: The Songs of Willie P. Bennett</span>. The band had no plans to make a subsequent album but something unanticipated happened.<span><br/></span>“When we play together and sing together as Blackie and the Rodeo Kings. Something magical happens. We haven’t asked ourselves what it is all these years and we’re not going to start now” as Stephen Fearing describes it.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Recognizing this special chemistry and the resulting joy of creating music together has brought Blackie and The Rodeo Kings back to stage and studio again and again.

This beautifully twisted variety show is performed by Ingrid Hansen, who also puppeteers for Jim Henson Company’s Fraggle Rock. Watch behind-the-scenes as Hansen performs a live puppet film, animating cheeky vignettes in the palm of her hand and projecting them onto a huge screen. “Both live and magnified on screen, in cunningly angled cameras and mirrors, we see Hansen create characters from her own hands, fingers, tongue, in a saucy and jostling vaudeville of ‘stars’. NUTTY, INGENIOUS, MESMERIZING.” - 12th Night. Costumes by JIMBO (winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race.) <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>ABOUT THE ARTIST:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Hot off a tour to the most prestigious puppet festival in Montreal, Danish-Canadian puppeteer Ingrid Hansen tours her spicy puppetry cabaret after shooting 2 seasons of Fraggle Rock with the Jim Henson Company. She spent a year traipsing through Brooklyn’s parks puppeteering a big orange monster on Sesame’s new Emmy-Award-Winning series ‘Helpsters,’ alongside human actors Andrea Martin, John Oliver, Terry Crews, and Margaret Cho. At home in Victoria, Canada, Ingrid also co-creates puppet theatre with the “big kids” inside federal prisons.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ingrid was born and raised in Kelowna BC by gregarious Danish immigrants.  She grew up stealing apples from the neighbor's orchard, tubing down Mission Creek. She spent every summer of her childhood eating fresh cherries and peaches until she exploded, and she always, always, misses Okanagan fruit.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Utterly magical, insanely inventive, wickedly funny, BEAUTIFULLY TWISTED, and occasionally erotic! ★★★★★” - Free Press<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“GENIUS PHYSICAL COMEDY!” - Entertainment World<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>SHOW CREDITS:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Produced by SNAFU Society of Unexpected Spectacles<span><br/></span>Co-created & Directed by Britt Small<span><br/></span>Co-created & Performed by Ingrid Hansen<span><br/></span>Co-produced by, and with creative contributions from, Kathleen Greenfield<span><br/></span>Costume Design by JIMBO The Drag Clown (James Insell) <span><br/></span>Interstitial Film Editing by Pedro M.

Our show in development is a one-man show called Is It My Time? Catch a glimpse as to what a dancer goes through while working on their craft. As they move, what are they thinking about? What is their driving force to keep going? What is working in their creative process like? One moment, he passes back and forth between dance sequences and one-sided conversations and whimsically carries himself through the regiment of dance. The next, he feels the weight and hardship of the long pursuit of obtaining his dream career. All this leads up to one of the biggest questions of a dancer’s life. Is it my time? Provoke - A Fringe Show is a showcase of two dance works that are meant to help be a conversation starter on topics that have become more prevalent in today’s society, by providing a different platform to share an interpretation of these topics to hopefully bring newfound exposure and understanding for audience members while provoking deeper conversations afterwards. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Confirming your reservation in advance is strongly recommended as space is limited due to COVID-19 safety measures. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please note: personal protective equipment (such as masks) is mandatory and social distancing will be in effect.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>*As part of RCA's COVID-19 health and safety measures, entry to the theatre of the ticket holders will be staggered.

Beginning with physical warm-ups based on tai chi exercises and easy-to-follow low impact stepping patterns, improvisation is then explored together through building movement phrases, energetic action games and embodied imagery. These become vocabulary for improvised ensemble creations, danced to a variety of music. Claudia shares the many benefits of improvised dance to stimulate creativity, enhance listening and explore physical play in a safe and respectful environment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Contact Improvisation with Hailey McCloskey - May 25 and June 29, 2024<span><br/></span>Contact Improvisation and the Dance of Relating:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Contact Improvisation (CI) is an improvised dance form involving physical contact between two or more dancers. Unlike other partner forms that rely on the hands, CI invites us to “listen” to our partner through a variety of surfaces on our torso and limbs. In CI, communication is refined by increasing our embodied awareness and by using shared “languages” such as Rolling Point of Contact and Sloughing / Sliding (terms that will be explained in class). Dances can range from the slow and meditative to the dynamic and acrobatic. Directions and possibilities can be invited via subtle changes of pressure at the skin surface, whereas playing with skeletal support structures, timing, and connectivity can invite shared weight, dynamic movements, and even the sense of flight. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Hailey teaches this practice with an emphasis on learning to move from your own internal rhythm while being informed and guided by the space and the people in it. This is a great movement modality to build proprioception, fitness, new neural pathways, and relational creativity - all leading to a satisfying art form, and ripe with transferable skill building.<span><br/></span>Wear comfortable clothes for dancing. Long pants, long sleeves, & knee pads recommended. No need to bring a partner.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Dance Improvisation, with Guest Artists Karen and Allen Kaeja (Toronto) - June 15, 2024 <span><br/></span>Creative Fire<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Karen and Allen Kaeja will share their collaborative approach of listening, creating and inspired moving together. Investigating gesture and movement infused by identity and meaning, the workshop is fuelled by imagery and physical gesture, in and out of contact, as a generative and wholesome experience. Participants personal material will serve as kindling for the creative fire. Karen and Allen draw on 40 years of practice in improvisation, contact dance and professional creation with dancers and non-pro community movers. All are welcome. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Refund Policy: No refunds after classes have begun. <span><br/></span>

	Thursday, September 19th | 7:30 pm - 9:45 pm | Mary Irwin Theatre | $50 (incl. taxes and ticketing fees)<span><br/></span>Intermission: 15 minutes<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Mysticssippi” blues man <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://harrymanx.com/\">Harry Manx</a> has been called an “essential link” between the music of East and West, creating musical short stories that wed the tradition of the Blues with the depth of classical Indian ragas. He has created a unique sound that is hard to forget and deliciously addictive to listen to.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Harry forged his distinctive style by studying at the feet of the masters, first as a sound man in the blues clubs of Toronto during his formative years and then under a rigorous tutelage with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt in India. Bhatt is the inventor of the 20-stringed Mohan Veena, which has become Harry’s signature instrument. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Harry played slide guitar for many years before meeting Bhatt in Rajasthan,in fact he had been living in another part of India for many years already, but he started at the beginning under Bhatt’s tutelage, unlearning most of what he knew about playing a slide instrument. He learned Eastern scales and eventually ragas, deceptively complex and regimented musical patterns that form the basis of Indian composition. Learning the voicings of Indian music is a subtle art that comes with time. Harry spent most of twelve years in India learning that. It was later on that Harry decided to explore the connection between Indian ragas and blues scales which eventually led to the Indo-blues hybrid that has become his style. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Born on the Isle of Man, Manx immigrated to Ontario with his parents when he was a child. He started working with bands as a ‘roadie’ at age 15 and gradually worked his way up to becoming the regular sound man at the well-known El Mocambo (blues) club in Toronto. There he worked with a slew of blues legends. Harry admits that blues is still at the heart of much of his work. “I’ve always had one foot in the blues from those days … what I got from those artists is a groove. That’s what I’m particularly interested in is the groove, and that’s the way I play blues”. “I went to Europe when I was 20 and started making money as a busker,” recalls Manx. “I’ve worked mostly as a musician since then, though I did some theatre work for a while. I was a one-man band with a drums and a cymbals for a time too. It was really a lot of fun” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Manx’s time in India has imbued his music with an intangible spiritual quality. “the song reveals who you are, it’s the vehicle for your message, your inspirational ideas or your story,” explained Manx. “Like many people I’m interested in my own development as a person and that’s represented in my songs, I’m searching for truth through art and spirituality. My songs are a synthesis of everything I’ve absorbed, all my experiences and I share that. I’m glad that it means something to people.” <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Indian music moves a person inward,” he explains. “It’s traditionally used in religious ceremonies and during meditations because it puts you into this whole other place (now, here). But Western music has the ability to move you outward, into celebration and dance. There are some ragas that sound bluesy, and there are ways to bend strings while playing blues that sound Indian. I may be forcing the relationship between the two musical cultures, but I keep thinking they were made for each other. That leads me to more and more experimentation. The journey has been great so far.” Manx is a prolific artist, releasing 12 albums in a 12 year span with no signs of stopping. He has received seven Maple Blues Awards, six Juno nominations, the Canadian Folk Music Award in 2005 for Best Solo Artist and won CBC Radio’s “Great Canadian Blues Award” in 2007. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>His most recent original release, “Om Suite Ohm” was voted by the Montreal daily La Presse as one of only 4 CDs to watch for in 2013. Guitar Player Magazine called it “his most fully realized work to date”. Blend Indian folk melodies with slide guitar blues, add a sprinkle of gospel and throw in some compelling grooves. It’s a recipe that goes down easy and leaves you hungry for more.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.shermandoucette.com/\">Sherman Doucette</a> is a celebrated blues harmonica player and vocalist with a career spanning over five decades.

When her exasperated parents cut off her blood supply, Sasha's life is in jeopardy. Luckily, she meets Paul, a lonely teenager with suicidal tendencies who is willing to give his life to save hers.

  schema:name "Impressionistic Floral Painting";
  schema:description """
	This workshop is designed for advanced beginners and intermediate students -  all mediums welcome. Ann Willsie, the instructor, works in oils. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When painting florals, Ann tries to capture the essence of what she sees before her; the line, rhythm, flow of the stalks and petals. Artists get caught up in trying to reproduce exact replicas of what we see,  getting lost in the detailing, instead of trying to capture the soul of what is before you. Ask yourself this  – why do I want to paint this? What is it about this particular flower or scene that stirs me? Is it the colors? the line and movement? The intricate design? Or perhaps it is the play of light and shadows falling across the petals and leaves. This will be the focus of the workshop. The goal is to loosen you up and to help you see the big picture. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Each morning starts with a brief discussion followed by a short demo and exercises . After this, each student works on their own, from live flowers set up around the room. Ann provides one-on-one assistance throughout the day to help students with any issue/concerns that they may have with their work.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Registrants must bring their own materials, which should include canvas, paints (oil, acrylic, or watercolour), palette, brushes, and reference photo.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The workshop runs for two (2) days, Saturday and Sunday from 10:00am to 4:00pm:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>October 23 - 24, 2021<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Cost: $280 + GST<span><br/></span>Instructor: Ann Willsie<span><br/></span>Venue: Salloum Rehearsal Hall<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Early registration is highly recommended as spots are limited due to social distancing.

	It has been a wild ride since James Mullinger’s Embrace Where You Live Comedy show was originally scheduled in April of 2020, but the good news is that James is coming to Kelowna and this show will be happening on September 30, 2021.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Due to COVID restrictions, we have had to make some changes to the scheduling so that we are following all provincial health orders put in place for the safety of the staff, audience and performers and we thank you for your support and understanding. Train Wreck Comedy and the Rotary Centre of the Arts are doing everything we can to make sure you will be able to enjoy this show in a safe and comfortable environment.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>James Mullinger is excited to be back on stage and at no point did he ever want to cancel this tour! We look forward to seeing you on Thursday, September 30, 2021, for a well-earned and much-needed laugh.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>The Rotary Centre Box Office will be in touch with current ticket holders shortly, if they have not been already, to explain the changes due to the current PHO. If you don’t have your tickets yet, don’t wait too long as this show will sell out soon.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Thanks again for your patience, support and understanding through these incredibly challenging times.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Rob Balsdon<span><br/></span>Owner Train Wreck Comedy<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>-------<span><br/></span>ABOUT JAMES MULLINGER<span><br/></span>On April 28, 2016, Comedian James Mullinger sold out Harbour Station Arena in Saint John, outselling Jerry Seinfeld, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Jeff Dunham! The stand up special of the show itself was picked up by Hulu and Amazon Prime so his tales of life in Atlantic Canada are now being enjoyed by people in Germany, Japan and America.<span><br/></span>In April 2018 he sold out Harbour Station a second time, this time beating his own record which made headlines across the pond.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>James tours extensively to packed houses across Canada and England. A big-budget movie had been made about his early years in stand up (starring actors from Twilight, Downton Abbey and Notting Hill and comedians such as Jimmy Carr, Gilbert Gottfried, Mike Ward and Pete Zedlacher). It was described by NME as the “funniest film of the year,” “unmissable” by GQ Magazine and “essential viewing. A funny, realistic look at what it takes to become a stand-up comedian,” by the Montreal Times. Watch the trailer here.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Comedian James Mullinger is one of Canada’s biggest cheerleaders. He loves it here and spends his time promoting it across the world and raising money for charities and non-profits. James has raised more than $100,000 for Canadian charities. He has also become one of Canada’s top comics, being nominated for both a Just For Laughs comedy award and a Canadian Comedy Award for Best Live Show.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/h9auqfEhB3c\">TRAILER</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>--------<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Rotary Centre for the Arts continues to closely monitor and follow all BC Provincial Health Orders.

	As part of our celebration of Black History Month, the RCA is proud to present a screening of Cheryl Foggo's new documentary, John Ware Reclaimed. Join us February 25 at 7:00 PM in the Mary Irwin Theatre for this stirring, deeply personal portrait of John Ware, a Black cowboy and rancher who settled in Alberta prior to the turn of the 20th century. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Directed by celebrated playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker, and author Cheryl Foggo, John Ware Reclaimed digs past the racist myths and mistellings that surround Ware's life. Along the way, Foggo recalls her childhood in Calgary, Alberta, her own experiences of racism, and her family's history as part of the 1910 migration to western Canada to escape persecution and violence in the US south. Featuring stunning original songs by Miranda Martini (Foggo's daughter) and iconic country-western singer, Corb Lund. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Our screening of John Ware Reclaimed will be followed by a special talk-back session featuring Kenny \"Blues Boss\" Wayne, co-host of the RCA's long-running community program, School of Blues. In addition to offering his thoughts on the film, Wayne will perform a short set on the Mary Irwin Theatre stage.

  schema:name "Luca Fogale, Nothing is Lost Tour";
  schema:description """
	RCA Presents: Luca Fogale in concert. Part of the Nothing is Lost Tour. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>SPECIAL OFFER: Until midnight on February 26, use promo code LUCA2022 when purchasing your tickets online to receive two tickets for the price of one! Don't delay, supplies are limited: only twenty 2-for-1 packages are available. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>About Luca Fogale:<span><br/></span>“Amongst all these villains, I will be your friend,” Luca Fogale sang on his 2016 single “Villains,” and all these years later, he’s stayed true to that mission. It’s fitting that the debut album where that song originated was called Safety, because that’s always been Luca’s mission in music: to provide comfort and sanctuary, not just from the cruel world that can so often bring us down, but from the dark thoughts and messy feelings that can plague us in our most insecure moments. Raised on a steady diet of Nina Simone and Joni Mitchell, the singer/songwriter from Burnaby, British Columbia possesses a voice that seems soft and gentle on the surface, but cuts deep to reveal hidden truths and suppressed emotions. “I grew up in not the most expressive family,” Luca reflects, “and we were conservative both in the way that we interacted with each other and the way we all bottled things up.” He’s spent his musical career making up for lost time, creating songs that aren’t afraid to be tender, vulnerable, and brutally honest.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>With Safety, we were introduced to a songwriter with a fine-tuned ear for warm, wool-sweater melodies, richly rendered narratives, and intimate autumnal ambiance, like Jeff Buckley timewarped into Bon Iver’s wood cabin. That album—and its gospel-gilded 2017 follow-up single “I Don’t Want to Lose You”—pegged Luca as an indie-folk phenom on the rise, with streaming stats well into the seven figures. But his 2020 follow-up, Nothing Is Lost, revealed there was a whole lot more to Luca than prettily played serenades on acoustic guitar and piano. Through a broader palette of synth-washed atmospheres, orchestral flourishes, and lush ‘70s soft-rock arrangements, the album sees Luca graduate from the proverbial coffeehouse to the concert hall, recasting his private conversations as cinematic set pieces. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>However, his musical vision expands, Luca’s songwriting keeps drilling down into the deepest corners of his soul, as he reckons with crises both spiritual and existential in search of inner peace and redempetion. But  “Something I've really struggled with my entire life is feeling worthy and purposeful and that my life has value,” Luca admits. “A lot of these songs are meditations and reminders to myself of how I want to live my life: the ways in which I want to think about myself and think about the people in my life, and how I want to be seen. I'm still learning about what sort of music I want to make and what kind of artist I want to be. Obviously, it's a lifelong process.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information and links to Luca's music see his website:<span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lucafogale.com\">lucafogale.com</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

	This event is sold out.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Nestled deep in the beautiful Kootenay mountains of Western Canada lies the home of Moontricks, a duo whose timeless sound captures the essence of their rugged roots. Combining their love of folk, blues, and electronic music, Nathan Gurley and Sean Rodman are blazing their own trail, merging musical worlds previously unacquainted and capturing audiences along the way.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Since connecting in their rural hometown through a shared love of music, the pair’s chemistry was instantly apparent. With Gurley at the production helm and Rodman on songwriting and vocals, they’ve birthed an authentically raw and seductive sound infusing grassroots blues, wistful soul, and gritty, boot­stomping bass. Their breakout organic hit “Home” has surpassed 1 million streams and their music is frequently licensed for film and television.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Once a best­ kept secret in Canada's festival circuit, Moontricks is now taking their sound worldwide. Feeling just as at home on an electronic festival stage one weekend and a folk festival the next, their spirited live performances feature an assemblage of guitar, keys, banjo, and vocals atop stunning original productions. Their touring schedule has seen them play across North America and Australia with stops at major festivals like Lightning In A Bottle, Rainbow Serpent, and Shambhala Music Festival ­ where they’ve become fan favourites, playing every year since their debut in 2013.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>From rural beginnings to global festival stages, this humble duo is now taking on the world. Dazzling audiences with their infectious vibe and unmistakable rhythm, Moontricks are clear proof that originality and passion can spark a creative odyssey.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This show is co-presented with Footwerk Events, and made possible with funding from the BC Touring Council, the Province of British Columbia, the BC Arts Council, and the City of Kelowna. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please note that to enter the Mary Irwin Theatre, patrons will be required to provide proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 using a valid QR code-based proof-of-vaccination document and a secondary piece of government-issued photo ID. Masks also remain mandatory throughout the RCA, including while seated in the Mary Irwin Theatre. Patrons may remove their masks only temporarily, while actively eating or drinking.

  schema:description """
	When filmmaker Suzanne Crocker (director of 2015 Hot Docs audience favourite All the Time in the World) suggests that her family spend a year eating only locally sourced food, her husband and three teenagers are skeptical. What complicates this experiment is that the family lives in a remote Yukon town, less than 300 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle—not exactly an easy place to access fresh-grown food all year round. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://firstweeat.ca/\">First We Eat</a> follows Suzanne and her family as they hunt, forage, fish, grow and raise their own food, struggling along the way to create a meal plan with variety and flavour. In perhaps the most bizarre effort to inject some seasoning into her cooking, Suzanne even dries human blood to use as salt. Filmed primarily by the director herself, this challenging look at food security and sustainability is also an intimate study of a family in the midst of a tough but rewarding experiment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Watch the trailer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LmBY915KNQ&amp;t=2s\">HERE</a>.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>*As part of RCA's COVID-19 health and safety measures, entry to the theatre of the ticket holders will be staggered.

	\"Saudade is a Portuguese word. When I looked it up, I found terse translations: nostalgia; longing; missing; yearning. The program note expands on that, describing the word as “a vague, constant desire for a reality that does not, and probably can not, exist. It is the love that exists after someone is gone. It describes a deep emotional state of profound melancholic longing, often carrying a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never return. To feel saudade is to feel a deep incompleteness and recognize it as familiar.”\" - Jerry Hochman, from review in CriticalDance<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“As Saudade came to a close and the audience roared, this quote by Maya Angelou came to mind, “At the end of the day people won’t remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel.” Beamish’s cast spoke with the most brilliant dance vocabulary but the feeling of saudade that swirled inside me as the men glided across the floor is what I’ll never forget.” – Madison Embrey, New York Rag<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

With a fresh take on traditional Celtic tunes, The McDades bring a high-energy kitchen party with a jazzy spin to the Mary Irwin Theatre.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Punching through the walls of tradition, The McDades’ Celtic-rooted music fuses the spontaneity of jazz improvisation and infectious global rhythms. The JUNO award winners’ cutting-edge sound is the perfect complement to their fiery performances.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>At the heart of the group are siblings Shannon, Solon, and Jeremiah, who grew up playing Canadian folk music alongside their parents and among artists from around the world; a unique upbringing that led to a love and respect for all music. Their ground-breaking compositions and innovative arrangements are characterized by stunning virtuosity and a near-telepathic interaction on stage.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>With vocal harmonies that can only come from a family, and an obvious love for each other and their music, The McDades’ sound is immersed in the spirit of improvisation. Combining original tunes and unique interpretations of traditional songs, their performances feature both energetic instrumentals and moving vocals performed in English and French. This compelling and dynamic group finds their groove “somewhere between a down-home kitchen party, a jazzy after-hours club, and a folk festival.” (London Free Press)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The McDades are winners of the JUNO Award for Best Roots Album (Group) and two Canadian Folk Music Awards (World Group of the Year and Instrumental Album of the Year.)

Together as Tower of Song the two have arranged some of Cohen's timeless songs beautifully, for two voices, string bass, piano, guitar, and banjo.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Encouraged by the audience response, they continued to present the show regionally, and after several sold-out shows, Tower of Song put \"more power in the tower,\" recording their debut album In City and In Forest, with Juno award winning producer Joby Baker.  They have since toured several times across BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, playing more than 200 shows to thousands of people at theatres, festivals and folk clubs across Canada.  Highlights include Salmon Arm Roots and Blues Festival, West End Cultural Centre (Winnipeg), Aeolian Hall (London), the Rotary Centre for the Arts (Kelowna), and the Dave Dunnet Theatre (Victoria).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"The tunes are hauntingly lovely. Wonderful takes with close harmonies and violent re-rhythmings. Musically sound. Faithful by being strongly, creatively Cohen, and yet wholly their own.\"- James N.

Featuring acoustic guitar (Jordan Klassen), fiddle (Chloe Davidson), banjo and mandolin (Chris Baxter), and upright bass (Nils Loewen) the band makes a big sound that tips its cap to traditional bluegrass while incorporating singer-songwriter music intentionally put together with clever, inventive song arrangements, emotive instrumental breaks and powerful vocal harmony. Their shows commonly feature dancing, laughter, joyful hoots and hollers and serene moments accompanied by tears and tranquil sighs of release or appreciation. They are a heartfelt, talented string quartet that blends uplifting energy with a reflective reverence for the difficulties of reality that marries joy and sorrow and declares “YES”. Yes to all that it means to be alive on this planet, here and now. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Joining the band is Kian Dye, a mandolin player from the Pacific Northwest, who has performed with numerous bands in Oregon, Washington and beyond. A rising star in the Northwest bluegrass community, in 2023 Kian received the Oregon Bluegrass Association’s Steve Waller Grant, and won the 2023 Monroe Mandolin Appreciation Society Tune Writing Contest hosted by Christopher Henry (Peter Rowan Bluegrass Band). <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Under The Rocks will be celebrating the release of their second studio album, Honest Try, which is available on all platforms starting February 16, 2024. While often busy touring throughout the year, this will be their first local since last summer and it is currently the only Kelowna show in the books for 2024. They will perform their new record - as well as some other fan favourites - and have brand new merchandise to boot! Honest Try is their finest work yet. It ranges through 12 original compositions that include upbeat bluegrass songs, eclectic fiddle tunes and thoughtful ballads ripe with philosophical musings.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Website:<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.undertherocksband.com/\"> Under the Rocks</a><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z_0olpa1UY\">Watch Video</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Refund Policy: No refunds for this event.<span><br/></span>

We all know what happened next, which led me into a bit of a new path: teaching. I am now a student at Swing Literacy Teacher Development.

Mezzo soprano Marion Newman, of Kwagiulth and Stó:lō First Nations with English, Irish and Scottish heritage; Métis soprano Melody Courage, and Algonquin director Yvette Nolan, have teamed up with Opera Kelowna for an evening that upends expectations and invites everyone to take up the joy, and the work, of building a better future together.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Marion Newman and Melody Courage take centre stage as co-hosts of the first episode of their cheeky new talk show, “Wreckonciliation.” With their (surprise) guests, they tackle issues of the day with wit and compassion. Together, they explore what ‘reconciliation’ has come to stand for, not only in terms of new learning and opportunities, but in sometimes officious, and occasionally unwelcome ways as well. They weave together the deeply serious and fully comical, and they break into song whenever the words are not enough.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>The show features well-loved, and soon-to-be classics, crafted by Ian Cusson, Gabriel Fauré, Marion Newman, Gustav Mahler, Yvette Nolan & Dean Burry, Jacques Offenbach, and many others. The music will cycle through elemental themes of water, fire, air, and earth as a means of musically grounding a conversation in the heart of what makes living possible for us all.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information, please visit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.operakelowna.com/production/wreckonciliation_2024/\">www.operakelowna.com</a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Refund Policy: No Refunds for this Event.

  schema:description """
	In this workshop, students will create zines and learn about their history and importance in the art world. These will include reasons relating to accessibility, showcasing portfolio art, and activism. We will use paper and learn how to construct a zine through different methods for creating mini-books, including single paper folds and multi-paper folds for creating a mini-book. We will use various art forms within our zines, and registrants will be encouraged to explore new ways of getting creative, whether that’s through drawing, painting, poetry, clip art, flower pressings, and much more! The course objective is to open students up to accessible ways of creating art at their fingertips that they can easily share with their communities and to explore new ways of making art.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Registration for this four-week series is $60, and includes all four classes. Zines for Teens runs Mondays from 5:30-7:00 PM in the Harmony Honda Painting and Drawing Studio, April 4-25. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Please note that masks are mandatory at all times in the RCA, including during classes in the Harmony Honda Painting and Drawing Studio. Masks may be removed only temporarily, when students are actively eating or drinking. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
