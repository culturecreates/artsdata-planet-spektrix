With country iconic hits like Just Like You, I Believe in Angels, Drinkin’ Thinkin’, Daughters of the Sun, I Got This, I Want You To Live, Slow Dance and many, many more, he is also a highly regarded humanitarian, strong supporter of the military, and, most important, a proud father and devoted husband.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Canyon’s tireless work as spokesperson for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and his ongoing support for Canada’s Armed Forces has earned him much National and International recognition.

  schema:description """
	$39 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>I Went to Find You out 5/30/25 (Last Gang Records) The first solo album from Amy Millan in over 15 years, I Went To Find You emerged from the kind of once-in-a-lifetime serendipity that alters our experience of the world. After crossing paths with award-winning musician/composer Jay McCarrol in fall 2023, the Montreal-based singer/songwriter felt a sense of musical communion reminiscent of the elation she’d first accessed in singing with her father as a little girl-a connection severed when her dad was killed in a car accident just before her fifth birthday. As she began creating songs with McCarrol, Millan slowly realized that an unconscious desire to sustain that feeling had informed her lifelong devotion to music and her many cherished collaborations over the years, including her work as co-founder of beloved indie-pop band Stars and a satellite member of iconic collective Broken Social Scene.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“I so clearly remember being a kid and putting on my pajamas and being so excited for nighttime, because that’s when my dad and I would sing together,” Millan says. “Ever since then I’ve tried to make my life an arrow back to that feeling, but I didn’t fully understand that until now.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In selecting a title for her third solo effort, she chose to honour that sense of revelation and self-discovery. “A lot of this record had me looking into my past for clues on who I have become and why,” says Millan, who names longtime musician-friends like Feist, Broken Social Scene’s Kevin Drew and Charles Spearin, Metric’s James Shaw, Stars’ Chris Seligman, and her husband and Stars bandmate Evan Cranley among the musical kin who’ve profoundly enriched her life. “The ‘you’ of the title is the people I found, the people I went looking for after they’d gone—and the ‘you' is the person you become when all these components align.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>I Went To Find You began taking shape soon after she and McCarrol first linked up at Dream Serenade (an annual fundraiser hosted by singer/songwriter Hayden at Toronto’s Massey Hall). At the suggestion of McCarrol (who won a Canadian Screen Award for composing the score to the critically acclaimed 2023 film BlackBerry), Millan stepped in for Feist and joined Hayden for a duet on his bittersweet and breezy “On a Beach,” with McCarrol singing backup. “Before the show Jay and I went backstage and sang the song together, and I had this visceral reaction that almost felt like my body going into shock,” she recalls. “I realized I’d spent so long trying to find that vocal harmony that puts me back into a place of bliss and safety.”

Following two incredible Canadian support tours with Allison Russell and Dan Mangan, this spring’s Eastern Canadian tour, as well as countless global festival appearances, it is now time for Aysanabee to take center stage and share his powerful music—including the radio hit singles \"Nomads,\" “We Were Here,” \"Somebody Else,\" and his newest radio charting single “Edge Of The Earth”—along with his engaging storytelling.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The alternative indie artist, of Sucker Clan from the Sandy Lake First Nation, a remote fly-in community in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, now calls Toronto home. He began making music under his mother’s maiden name when moments of stillness allowed him to slow down and create music that truly represented him as an artist. He’s been compared to Hozier and Kings of Leon, among others.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In March 2024, Aysanabee made history as the first Indigenous artist to win the JUNO Awards for Alternative Album of the Year and the coveted Songwriter of the Year for his EP Here and Now. His debut album, Watin (Nov 2022), named after his grandfather, combined music and journalism with artistry and expression and was shortlisted for the 2023 Polaris Music Prize.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Since 2021, he has performed over 300 shows across Canada and globally, including tours abroad with Kim Churchill (AUS) and Skye Wallace (IT), and international festivals Reeperbahn (DE), The Great Escape (UK), SXSW Sydney (AUS), Tallinn Music Week (ES), and AmericanaFestUK (GB).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">“Aysanabee is a big presence even alone on stage…and the adoring crowd makes it clear it will follow him back after he departs to thunderous cheers.”</span><span><br/></span>- NEXT Magazine<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">“Aysanabee offered stories behind the selections of his heartfelt tales to the point where the audience didn't want him to leave the stage.”</span><span><br/></span>- Toronto Star<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">\"Can’t miss concert!\"</span><span><br/></span>- Exclaim<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">\"Special show coming to town that alternative, indie and folk music lovers won’t want to miss\"</span><span><br/></span>- Guelph Mercury Tribune<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">“His guitar work was ridiculously brilliant.

	$50 Regular<span><br/></span>Includes fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Heart single-handedly broke the mold of male-dominant rock in 1976 with their debut album ‘Dreamboat Annie’, which featured hits Crazy On You, Magic Man and Barracuda. Subsequent albums gave us hits such as Heartless, Straight On, Tell It Like It Is, What About Love? Never, These Dreams, Nothin’ At All, Alone, Who Will You Run To and All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Barracuda, a tribute to Heart, first hit the stage in 2011, and rapidly became the top Heart tribute in North America. In 2012, having heard rave reviews of Barracuda, Heart’s original lead guitarist and co-writer, Roger Fisher, drove from Seattle to Vancouver with brother Michael, Heart’s original manager and sound technician, and also the subject of the song ‘Magic Man’ to see Barracuda. Roger and Michael went on record saying that Barracuda was the best Heart tribute they had ever seen, and they had seen many.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Roger was so impressed with Barracuda\" that he made several special guest appearances with Barracuda, on both sides of the border. Based in Vancouver, BC, Barracuda’s DL Car covers the vocals of Ann Wilson with absolute perfection, which is not an easy task. Her precision is nothing short of breath-taking. Sourced out of Portland, Oregon is Sarah Moon, who perfectly covers the vocals and guitar of Nancy Wilson. On lead guitar, keyboards and harmony vocals is Ray Roper, formerly of recording artists Stonebolt. Multi-instrumentalist Darryl Hebert plays keyboard, electric and acoustic guitars, keytar, banjo and mandolin. Mark Kenny, plays bass, and veteran of many Vancouver-based bands, Doug Grant plays drums. In honoring Heart’s roots and history, Barracuda includes two or three Led Zeppelin classics in their set.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Barracuda captures the sound of Heart down to the finest detail both vocally and instrumentally and has to be seen to be believed!

	<span class=\"BoldText\">$39.00 Per Person</span><span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span>Born in Mont-Laurier, Quebec, to parents who were passionate about music, Bobby Bazini was introduced to the folk and country sounds of Americana at a young age. As a teenager, he moved in with his grandmother Louise, who encouraged him to pursue his passion for music; it was while exploring his collection of Johnny Cash vinyl records that he decided to make music his preferred mode of expression, drawing inspiration from legends such as Bob Dylan and Otis Redding.<span><br/></span>Bobby then began performing in the Laurentians and quickly attracted attention. In 2007, the manager of a local radio station sent his songs to a Montreal talent scout, who signed him his first record deal. Two years later, Bobby released his first single, I Wonder, which was an immediate success in Canada, staying in the top 3 of the ADISQ charts for eight weeks. Her debut album, Better in Time, was quickly certified gold and a few months later certified platinum and was released by Warner Music France in 28 European countries. In 2014, Bobby signed with Universal Music and released his second album, Where I Belong, his \"American Dream Album\", recorded after a long road trip to Los Angeles and produced by Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell, Norah Jones, Tracy Chapman), with the contribution of legendary soul musicians such as Booker T. Jones and Jack Ashford.

While the two-actor play follows the budding romance of two young lovers, Cambridge University astrophysicist Marianne and beekeeper Roland, there’s more to Constellations than unlikely romance. British playwright Payne takes the traditional boy-meet-girl tale and flips it on its head by plunging both characters into the multiverse, where their love story is played out in all its variations.

As they approach their monumental 20th anniversary in 2026, the band is re-energized, re-inspired, and ready to launch a bold new chapter, creating fresh music for the first time in six years. Founding members Sanjay Seran and Ravi Binning continue to lead the charge, pushing Delhi 2 Dublin’s sound and vision to new heights.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>What began as a one-night collaboration at Vancouver’s Celtic Fest in 2006 quickly evolved into a global phenomenon, lighting up stages at Electric Forest (USA), Glastonbury (UK), Burning Man (USA), Bali Spirit Festival (Indonesia), and Woodford Folk Festival (Australia), among many others. Their music has taken them around the world, from the clubs of Mumbai to the deserts of Nevada, earning them a reputation for delivering “90 minutes of freebasing joy” at every show. For over a decade, violinist Serena Eades has been a driving force in the band, her electrifying performances and deep musicality adding a rich melodic layer to Delhi 2 Dublin’s ever-evolving sound.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Now, with fresh energy coursing through their veins, Delhi 2 Dublin welcomes producer, keyboardist, and tabla player Kal Mattu, who brings a renewed vibrancy to their ever-evolving sound.

Their 2019 album, We Got This, produced by Juno Award-winning Gavin Brown, marked a major milestone, earning commercial radio play for the song “My People.” Their innovative approach has secured top spots on international world music charts, millions of streams, multiple Western Canadian Music Awards, and recognition from major platforms like CBC Music, BBC Asian Network, and PBS.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>New music is on the horizon and the festival season promises to be bigger than ever, Delhi 2 Dublin is set to remind the world why they’ve remained at the top of the global bass music scene for two decades.

Welcome to the jubilant celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Tryzub Ukrainian Dance Society. Since its inception in 1974, Tryzub has stood as a beacon of artistic excellence, a symphony of spirited footwork and colorful costumes that tell the story of Ukraine’s rich heritage.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“DZVINKA,” Tryzub’s 50th Anniversary Show, is a unique 2-hour stage production that unveils over one hour of original music, composed and recorded amidst the shadows of war in Ukraine. Featuring new elaborate costumes crafted in Ukraine, the mesmerizing choreography takes audiences on a riveting journey encompassing excitement, anticipation, laughter, and moments of despair.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The first half of the show introduces an original storyline centered around Ukrainian folk hero Oleksa Dovbush—an outlaw, a hero to the people, and leader of the Opryshky. The second half navigates through the diverse regions of Ukraine, showcasing the delicate balance between intricate technique, colorful costumes, the grace and beauty of our female dancers, and the strength, determination, and gravity defying tricks of our male dancers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Despite formidable challenges, the costumes and music were created in Ukraine by brave individuals. As a result of the shutdown of Ukrainian airspace due to Russia’s war, the costumes were transported by van out of the country and then flown to Canada from neighboring nations. These costumes embody resilience amid adversity. As Russian military targets museums, theaters, and historical sites, orchestra musicians, scattered and forced to record in school classrooms, join hands with Tryzub in crafting original works like “DZVINKA.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Net Proceeds from the performance will be donated to support Ukrainian Newcomer programs that support the mental health and wellness of youth impacted by war.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	$49 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Kevin Kane first met Tom Hooper in 1977 (when they were aged 13 and 11) after Kevin and Tom’s older brother Chris bonded over a mutual love of The Beatles when the two had entered junior high school in Kelowna, BC. Kane started hanging out with the Hoopers in their basement for regular Friday night jam sessions, where they essentially learned to play their respective instruments together. By 1983 - influenced in equal parts by the British Invasion of the 60s and the DIY attitudes and immediacy of punk and new wave - the trio took the name The Grapes Of Wrath and began working on the songs that would make up their debut EP (1984) and first album (“September Bowl Of Green”) in 1985, released by the fledgling Vancouver indie Nettwerk Productions.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The band were soon signed by Capitol/EMI for the albums “Treehouse” (1987, with the breakout singles Peace Of Mind and Backward Town), “Now And Again” (1989, building on their successes with All The Things I Wasn’t and What Was Going Through My Head), and “These Days” (1991, featuring the hits I Am Here and You May Be Right). Thanks in no small part to the support of MuchMusic, The Grapes enjoyed gold and platinum sales and sold out shows at home in Canada, extensive radio play, and toured Europe twice in support of albums that also saw release in Japan, Australia, and South America. Then - with international success looming and for reasons no one is entirely clear on - the band disbanded in 1992.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tom and Kevin resurrected the Grapes in the late 90s, releasing the album “Field Trip” (2000) on the Song Corp label, who folded immediately after it’s release. They came together again in the summer of 2009 for a series of acoustic duo shows around BC, celebrating their enduring friendship and the music they had created together. The following year, an offer from a festival for a full band reunion led to the return of drummer Chris, and the original three recorded “High Road” (2013 - named after the street the Hoopers lived on when they first started playing together as kids), their first album of new material in almost 22 years. They have been gigging regularly ever since and are arguably the longest-running and still-active “original lineup” in rock. Now - and as they had done briefly in 2009 - Tom and Kevin will once again hit the road as a duo to perform The Grapes’ music in an intimate and unplugged setting - telling the stories behind the songs and putting the focus on the harmonies and melodies of their timeless music.

  schema:name "Jesse Roper";
  schema:description """
	$49.00 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Based in Victoria, BC, Jesse Roper is a blues/Americana artist with a penchant for writing modern indie-infused blues music and delivering bombastic live performances buoyed by his virtuosic guitar playing. His innate and impressive musical talent has served him well, giving him the flexibility to play with soul icon Booker T. Jones, rock veteran Colin James, blues belter Beth Hart, and Canadian legend Burton Cummings. The stage is where Roper shines. It has been his home since overcoming crippling stage fright during his early twenties. Fear is a part of Roper’s past that barely seems real today - especially when you see the in-concert image of a six-string soldier, hair matted to his face, tearing up the stage without a hint of second-guessing.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Roper’s last album ‘Horizons’ marked a sonic high point in his career thus far. Working closely with famed JUNO-nominated producer Gus van Go (Metric, The Stills, Whitehorse, Arkells, The Trews, Sam Roberts) on that new collection of songs has pushed Roper into creating some of his best work. “Recording with Gus was on a whole new level.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Roper latest releases are energetic, fresh, soulful and R&B-inspired tracks from a forthcoming LP that harkens the voices of JJ Cale, The Teskey Brothers, Leon Bridges, Ben Harper and others - while maintaining Roper's strong and unique expression in the genre. Jesse is a master at connecting his personal story and experiences to his songwriting - crafting narratives that hit on life's challenges and eccentricities - but that remain upbeat, engaging and wildly entertaining songs.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Adventuresome doesn’t properly describe Roper as an artist because when the guitar-wielding dynamo sets out to accomplish something, there’s no telling where his mind will wander or when his energy will go.

Co-created and exquisitely performed by multi-award winning Tymisha Harris, accompanied by a live 4-piece jazz band, Harris delivers “the tale that is probably the closest to an evening with Josephine Baker as one will ever experience…What makes this telling so powerful is that Harris can act, sing and dance. Because she is a world-class triple threat, Harris brings Baker back to us. There are no supporting roles, and the demands on Harris are huge. Her talent and commitment are more than up to the job. She is riveting!” – Stage Biz Reviews, NYC.

With such songs as “Pride and Joy”, “The House is Rockin’”, “Crossfire”, “Cold Shot”, “Little Wing”, “Life By the Drop”, “Tightrope”, “Voodoo Child”, “Look at Little Sister” and the unforgettable “Love Struck Baby”, his influence is still felt long after his tragic death.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Vocalist and guitar virtuoso RUSSELL EARL MARSLAND has been a powerful presence in the Vancouver music scene for more than 30 years.

It’s deep, bluesy and full of soul. He sings from the heart with fire and conviction. If you’ve never experienced the bounty of Russell Marsland, one of Canada’s top guitarist / singers then you’ve yet to tap into one of life’s unique resources. When it comes to guitar playing, you’ll marvel at his command of the instrument.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Russell and Stevie both had much love and Respect for Jimi Hendrix, BB King, Albert Collins, Albert King along with Wes Montgomery, Dick Dale and many other guitar greats!

	$49 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Signed to Atlantic/Warner Records at the tender age of 19, four-time Juno nominee and modern-day Renaissance woman Sarah Slean has since released 11 albums in over 10 countries worldwide – but perhaps the most astonishing aspect of her artistry is its breadth. Over her 25-year career, Slean has published two volumes of poetry, starred in short films and a movie musical (spawning two Gemini Award nominations), penned two string quartets and other chamber works, held numerous exhibitions of her paintings, and shared the stage with 10 of the country’s professional orchestras. Classically trained from the age of 5, she routinely collaborates with cutting-edge contemporary classical ensembles like The Art of Time and has been invited to sing world premieres by Canada’s leading living composers. She composes orchestral arrangements for her own music as well as for her pop colleagues (Dan Mangan, Hawksley Workman) and her recent collaborative recording with the Symphony Nova Scotia was just nominated for both an East Coast Music Award and a Juno Award in the Classical Album category (2021). Sarah is also a recent alumna of the prestigious Canadian Film Centre's screen composing residency (2017-18) and just earned her first Canadian Screen Award (2021).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Citing such diverse influences as Leonard Bernstein, philosophy, Joni Mitchell, Buddhism and Bach, her music borrows aspects of cabaret, pop, and orchestral: all knit together by the startling poetry of her lyrics, unique arranging and piano-playing, and that voice, described by the CBC as “a 19th century Kate Bush”. In addition to headlining theatres across Canada, Sarah has also toured Europe, the US and Scandinavia and has opened internationally for such artists as Bryan Ferry, Rufus Wainwright, Alanis Morissette, Andrew Bird, Feist, Ron Sexsmith, and Chris Isaak. Her 11th solo recording \"Metaphysics\", released in 2017, is described as a \"breathtaking amalgamation of Slean’s dramatic orchestral arranging and her signature take on songwriting\". In 2021-2022, Sarah will be composing the music for the stage musical adaptation of the award-winning film \"Maudie\".<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

This stand-out performance shone a bright light on this street poet from Vancouver’s Downtown East Side.<span><br/></span>Shane, an artist, inches away from living on the street and even in those troubled times, was putting out work like “<span class=\"BoldText\">To This Day</span>”, a video that’s garnered 24 million views and used worldwide in classrooms as a teaching tool, as well in speech and forensic competitions. His second book, “<span class=\"BoldText\">Stickboy</span>”, was adapted by Vancouver Opera. His voice has been sought after by luminaries like director George Miller, who worked with Shane on “<span class=\"BoldText\">Mad Max: Fury Road</span>”. Koyczan also created the piece, “<span class=\"BoldText\">Shoulders</span>”, which he toured with David Suzuki as part of The Blue Dot Tour, a movement to enshrine environmental rights in the constitution.<span><br/></span>A collaborator with artists such as Ani DiFranco, Dan Mangan, Tanya Tagaq, and others, Koyczan has elevated the Spoken Word art form, from its humble beginnings in after-hour cafes to stages both grand and distant. Shane brings an authenticity to his work that connects with audiences, as evidenced by his fiercely honest TED Talk, which highlights the kind of humanity he brings to each performance.<span><br/></span>Not just a poet moving from one subject to the next, Shane weaves his pieces together in a spellbinding narrative that show audiences themes that stretch over our lives. Koyczan continues moving through the difficult parts of our existence with humour in heart, and a notepad in hand; he scribbles down the whispers inside us and uses laughter as a poultice to press against our wounds.<span><br/></span>In 2017 Shane invited us deep into family trauma with the documentary “<span class=\"BoldText\">Shut Up And Say Something</span>”, an emotional trip through his past as he comes to terms with his estranged father. The film won Most Popular Documentary at Vancouver International Film Festival, moving audiences with its bravery and vulnerability.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>An artist whose work has transgressed genres and given breath to a new generation of voices, Shane Koyczan wears the mantle of human and dares others to discover what that means.

  schema:description """
	$59.00 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When attempting to provide an overview of a big story – one that encompasses both the myriad achievements of its subjects over a span of several decades and the impacts of those achievements – you can take two routes. There’s the “just the facts” approach, where you list off the people, places, and things that populate the tale, and then there’s another road that winds through the hows and whys behind the names and numbers. Looking at the story of Canadian indie rock institution Sloan, the temptation to look through both lenses is strong.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For those who prefer the factual take, there are certainly enough noteworthy events and experiences peppered through the bands over 30-year history to make for a good yarn. There are the various musical incarnations that flowered in the rather fertile indie music scene in the Halifax, Nova Scotia of the late 1980s and early 1990s that brought bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy, guitarists/vocalists Jay Ferguson and Patrick Pentland, and drummer/vocalist Andrew Scott together – bands such as The Deluxe Boys, Happy Co., No Damn Fears and Kearney Lake Road that anyone of a certain vintage who hails from the Canadian coastal city will recall fondly.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>There’s the first recorded appearance in 1991 of what could be their earliest signature tune, “Underwhelmed,” that landed on a very hard-to-find compilation of Halifax acts called Hear and Now, which – combined with a chaotic but explosive self-promoted showcase during a Halifax music festival – brought them to the attention of various record labels, including the label du jour of the early 1990s, Geffen Records imprint DGC.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>That tidbit leads to the next chain of events – signing to DGC and releasing their first album, 1992’s Smeared, recorded in the same home studio of Halifax producer Terry Pulliam as the Hear and Now session at roughly the same time, but preceding that with their own indie release, the Peppermint EP, on their own label, murderecords. Propelled by support from a newly influential network of college radio stations and indie-friendly print publications, the band toured the U.S. and Canada before setting up shop in New York City to record their second full-length, Twice Removed, with producer Jim Rondinelli.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>And here we have the first big plot twist of the fact-based version of the Sloan story. Somewhat bored with the shoegazey, Abba-meets-My Bloody Valentine approach to their songwriting that was so well documented on Smeared, and immersing themselves in the bare-boned sonic templates of The Beatles’ “White Album” and Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours while traversing the continent in tour vans, the band turned in to DGC an album that was stripped of the manic, fizzy energy of the debut – replaced with a clarity and cleverness that augmented the catchiness of such songs as “Coax Me”, “Snowsuit Sound” and “People of the Sky”. But that approach flew in the face of what was “shifting units” at the time, and DGC was, to use a predictable pun, underwhelmed by an album that would go on to be named “the best Canadian album of all time” by Canada’s Chart Magazine.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>While this turn of events would kill most bands (and has in many cases), for Sloan it led to perhaps the most impressive array of facts and figures in the story to date. Discouraged by response to the new album by their label and staring down the prospect of finishing out a contract with a disinterested benefactor, the band contemplated winding down in 1995, playing a handful of rapturously received shows and recording one last hurrah in the Halifax studio of producer/engineer Laurence Currie for an album to released on murderecords. That album, 1996’s One Chord to Another, would prove to be a benchmark in the Sloan story, racking up hit singles in “The Good in Everyone,” “Everything You’ve Done Wrong” and “The Lines You Amend” and giving the band their first gold album, and their best-selling album to date.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>From there, the facts lead to the next big chapter in the story – the release of Navy Blues in 1998 and the band’s embrace of riff rock, leading to such arena-ready singles as “Money City Maniacs” and “She Says What She Means” resulting in another gold-plus album and tours of Japan, the UK and Australia. That success spurred the band on to greater artistic heights – the highly regarded Between the Bridges came quickly after, in 1999 – and a glance at the band’s discography further illustrates the scope of ambition within Sloan when it comes to their recorded output, with not one but two double albums in their studio recordings (2006’s Never Hear the End of It and 2014’s Commonwealth). Celebrating their 20th anniversary with 2011’s The Double Cross, the band began to explore its own legacy with sumptuous reissues of Twice Removed, One Chord to Another and Navy Blues, while also striving to add to that legacy with such strong, strident efforts as 2018’s 12 and 2022's Steady.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>So those are the facts. But between those bridges there’s a wealth of information and experience that takes this story somewhere else – beyond the realm of “successful Canadian rock band” to “venerable indie rock institution” status. And yes, that’s the second time we’ve used the word “institution,” but hear us out.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Sloan is that rare band that has an ethos that accompanies its discography. From those early gigs in the basement of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design to the present day, the band has eschewed the typical star-making machinery that puts one member as the driving creative force, with the rest of the band serving as trusted accomplices. Sloan boasts four singing, songwriting multi-instrumentalists, all of whom contribute to the final fabric woven into each album. As a result you have a depth and breadth of music that defies simple characterizations like “power pop” or even “indie rock” – 2001’s Pretty Together balances ornate chamber pop with fist-pumping rockers, while later efforts such as Never Hear the End of It and 12 contain multitudes in their track listings, ranging from Dylanesque streams of consciousness to short, sharp shocks of hardcore. But somehow, it all remains quintessentially Sloan.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>That comes down to another integral part of this ethos we’re banging on about. From day one, the lineup of the band has remained unchanged. Through thick and thin, geographical relocation from Halifax to Toronto and who knows how many challenges along the way, the band has stayed intact. Sure, many can point to the band’s practice, perhaps inspired by their hardcore and post-rock heroes, of splitting the earnings evenly. But there’s more at play here. There seems to be a shared understanding between both the band members themselves and their devoted audiences around the world that Sloan is the sum of its parts, and if one member were to leave for whatever reason, that would bring the story to a close. You can call this commitment – to an ideal, to friendships, to the music itself. But it resonates through the songs, through the live performances, and through the relationship the band has with their fans.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ultimately, whichever route appeals most to you when looking at the big story that is Sloan, as you wind your way to the present day, there is one last thing worth considering – one bit of news that could be the starting point for the next attempt at approaching this story in the years ahead. In 2025, some 30-plus years on from when it all began, with the release of their 14th full-length album Based on the Best Seller, the tale is – thankfully – far from over.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“It's not a challenge to make a 14th album,” Jay Ferguson says, “But sometimes it's a challenge to think of a new overarching theme for a 14th album (and The Kinks’ 14th album was Soap Opera, essentially a TV play and complete story arc set to music, so clearly Ray Davies didn't have that problem). Our band has the capability to perform different styles within the rock/pop (or pop/rock) sphere, but it's often hard to harness the group to adhere to one particular style or theme. That's okay though. With four songwriters, we tend to make music that perhaps doesn't always naturally hang together under one (opened) umbrella but that's our style, and that style is continued on Based on the Best Seller. Nevertheless, whether it's Chris harmonizing on my songs, Patrick harmonizing on Chris' songs or Chris and our keyboardist Gregory vocally backing-up Andrew, I think those elements help tie together this (and previous) Sloan albums.”

Along the way, the sounds of “My Life”, “Candle in the Wind”, “Rocket Man”, “Just the Way You Are”, and many more classic hits create an evening that’s so much fun, you won’t want it to end. By the time you hit 1979, you’re begging these musicians to move back to 1970 and start all over again. With Witter at the grand piano and his incredibly talented band mates, the music is not an attempt to “recreate” or “mimic” the evening’s long list of familiar hits. Instead, Witter unleashes his golden tenor on hit after hit to recreate fully formed mental and emotional return visits to specific landmarks in a pop culture timeline.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>If you can remember where you were when Elvis may have died, this shows for you. If you can smell the interior of your 1973 VW Beetle, you’ll recognize every song. If you watch re-runs of Gilligan’s Island or Green Acres, you’ll find yourself singing along. And if you still have your bell-bottom jeans and Puma running shoes, then you probably need more help than Witter can provide...<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Now in its 16th year of touring, “The Piano Men” has enjoyed sold-out performances, return engagements and rave reviews in theatres across North America, Great Britain and Dubai. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip down memory lane!

And he may perform on the trombone as well to add a different flavour to the master’s brew. Whatever your musical taste(s), this will be Bach as you may have never heard him.

  schema:description """
	$28.25 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Yoga with Goats is back for another season of fun at the Historic O'Keefe Ranch! Join Samantha Richardson and our four-legged friends through a one-hour yoga session while immersed in the beautiful nature of the ranch. Class is 9-10am (please arrive at least 5-10 minutes early to settle in) and your ticket includes admission to explore Historic O'keefe Ranch once class is over. There is zero expectation to participate in the yoga poses and no pressure to do anything that you don't want to do. The flow of class will be very gentle and encourage you to slow down and be present in your body and in the present moment. Enjoy yourself while getting to know the friendly goats and join for a few nice stretches and mindful deep breaths if you feel called to. Bring a friend and the whole family to share in the experience and don't forget a camera to capture the memories! Please bring your own yoga mat or towel. You will be out in the elements, bring everything you need to be safe and comfortable - water bottle, sunscreen, etc. No refunds. In the event of heavy rain, class will be cancelled, and your ticket will be honored at one of our future dates. If you have any questions, please call Historic O'keefe Ranch at 250-542-7868 Thank you so much for your support! We look forward to sharing this unique, playful, and zen experience with you.
