He has been inducted into the Nova Scotia Country Music Hall of Fame, recorded 12 albums, and was presented with a certified Platinum Award for his debut album ‘One Good Friend’. With country iconic hits like Just Like You, I Believe in Angels, Drinkin’ Thinkin’, Daughters of the Sun, I Got This, I Want You To Live, Slow Dance and many, many more, he is also a highly regarded humanitarian, strong supporter of the military, and, most important, a proud father and devoted husband.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Canyon’s tireless work as spokesperson for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and his ongoing support for Canada’s Armed Forces has earned him much National and International recognition. Among them, he was honored with the Humanitarian Award by the Canadian Country Music Association, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal, and was also made the first ever Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets by the Honourable Peter MacKay, former Minister of National Defense.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Outside of his music and charitable work, many people might also recognize George for his numerous roles on the big screen. From Charlie Wells in the hit television show Heartland and the head forest ranger in Trailer Park Boys, to Bull Shelton in the Hallmark Channel’s highest-rated original Christmas movie “One Starry Christmas”. George also guest starred on stage in the musical production of Grease in 2018 at the Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Among his many identities, Canyon is also a proud Canadian and huge hockey fan, and roots for his team, the Calgary Flames, for which he sings the national anthem during the home games.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>George released his new memoir on November 8th, 2022 with Simon & Schuster Canada, titled ‘My Country’ - a heartfelt and candid memoir charting his humble beginnings in rural Nova Scotia, the hard-won success he found under the bright lights of Nashville, Tennessee, and the life lessons learned on and off the road that ultimately led him home.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">AARON PRITCHETT</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>He’s has been a household name in Canadian Country music for 20 years, but when Aaron Pritchett hits the stage, he does so with the energy and intensity of an artist fresh on the scene.

He could have stopped when he had enough to fill a Greatest Hits album - which he did in 2015 - but instead he followed it up with several more including his 2019 #1 single, “Better When I Do”.

Following two incredible Canadian support tours with Allison Russell and Dan Mangan, this spring’s Eastern Canadian tour, as well as countless global festival appearances, it is now time for Aysanabee to take center stage and share his powerful music—including the radio hit singles \"Nomads,\" “We Were Here,” \"Somebody Else,\" and his newest radio charting single “Edge Of The Earth”—along with his engaging storytelling.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The alternative indie artist, of Sucker Clan from the Sandy Lake First Nation, a remote fly-in community in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, now calls Toronto home.

He’s been compared to Hozier and Kings of Leon, among others.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In March 2024, Aysanabee made history as the first Indigenous artist to win the JUNO Awards for Alternative Album of the Year and the coveted Songwriter of the Year for his EP Here and Now.

  schema:name "Bobby Bazini presented by Creative Okanagan";
  schema:description """
	$39.00 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Since his very first career interview fifteen years ago, following the release of I Wonder, Bobby Bazini has often been asked the same question: why doesn't he sing in French? Journalists ask it during interviews, and fans bring it up after shows or when they approach him on the street. The desire was there, of course, but for years, he postponed the project — unsure of how to approach it, doubting himself, wondering whether he was capable and whether his audience would follow him on that path...<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In 2022, he began working on French-language songs with longtime collaborator Connor Seidel (1969 Collective, Charlotte Cardin, Les Sœurs Boulay). They spent an entire summer on it, but something wasn’t clicking. One day, in the middle of a studio session, they walked away — without finishing a single song. The disappointment was real, but Bobby realized he simply wasn’t ready. He shelved the project once again and focused on releasing his album Pearl.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>He then toured Western Canada, Europe, and across Quebec. During that time, he also began a personal journey: going back to school to finish high school, which he had left behind due to his music career. He reconnected with his former French teacher and spoke to her about his dream of making a French-language album. He showed her the lyrics he had written in French, and in return, she encouraged him to read more in that language to expand his vocabulary.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Because yes — he needed to find his voice in French. Having grown up immersed in English-language music, writing and singing in that language came naturally. French required a different creative process, a different way of making words resonate. At first, he focused heavily on the technical aspects; but over time, as he kept trying, fluency emerged. And with it, space for emotion — which unfolded in its own way, in his native tongue.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>One day, while printing his student ID card, he saw his full birth name: Bobby Bazinet. The moment hit him hard. For fifteen years, everyone had called him Bazini — to the point where he had almost forgotten his real last name. It felt like a liberation. It was right then that the desire to make a French-language album truly took shape.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The concept for Seul au cinéma came later, during the Pearl tour. While playing a show in Saint-Eustache, Bobby found himself performing in a venue that was part of a movie theatre complex. That afternoon, after soundcheck, the venue manager offered him free rein to roam the cinemas. He made himself a bucket of popcorn and wandered from screening room to screening room, coming and going freely — sometimes staying for just a few minutes, sometimes longer. There were no signs outside the doors, so he never knew what he was walking into: a horror film, a romantic comedy, a popular Quebec feature.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The experience stayed with him. It felt like drifting through fragments of stories, like hopping from one dream to another, never seeing how any of them ended. When he told Connor about it, the concept clicked instantly: Seul au cinéma — Alone at the Movies. Nine rooms. Nine songs. Nine films telling a story of identity, Bobby’s story, through solitude.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>With the theme in place, they had to define the album’s sonic universe. At first, Bobby and Connor thought of expanding on Pearl’s orchestral textures, and brought in Antoine Gratton and the Quatuor ESCA to record string arrangements. But as the sessions progressed, they felt they were straying from their desired sound.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In recent years, Bobby had been discovering French-language music, largely thanks to the parents of his partner Odessa. He grew particularly fond of Jim et Bertrand (he cites La tête en gigue as a favourite) and Rêver mieux by Daniel Bélanger. As it turned out, Connor also loved both of these albums — and they became central inspirations for Seul au cinéma. The balance of acoustic instrumentation and sampling in Rêver mieux, and the rich chord progressions of Jim et Bertrand, underpinned by melodies you sing at the top of your lungs at concerts or in the car — that’s the artistic path they chose to follow.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Eventually, Bobby and Connor stripped the sound down to its essence: just two guitars and a computer. They wanted to evoke the early 2000s, when acoustic guitar took center stage, while layering in modern touches through synths and sampling. Strings recorded by Antoine Gratton were re-sampled to create a more contemporary sound. They also incorporated ambient sounds captured in cinemas to further immerse listeners in the filmic atmosphere.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Several musicians contributed to the project: Robbie Kuster on drums, Conner Molander on keyboards, Alex Francoeur on flute and saxophone, and Odessa Pagé, Bobby’s partner, on backing vocals.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In many ways, the musical world of Seul au cinéma is a natural evolution of Pearl (which drew on influences like Bill Withers and Jorge Ben). It is Bobby’s dual identity — musical, linguistic, and personal — that gives rise to this singular sound.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Seul au cinéma will be released on September 19, and Bobby has never felt this eager for an album launch. To him, it feels like attending the premiere of his own movie — like watching himself play his own role, navigating the duality of Bazinet and Bazini. He wonders whether the public will follow him on this new journey.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Having long defined himself through his idols, Bobby Bazini now steps forward — stripped down, without artifice — in his own language.

While the two-actor play follows the budding romance of two young lovers, Cambridge University astrophysicist Marianne and beekeeper Roland, there’s more to Constellations than unlikely romance. British playwright Payne takes the traditional boy-meet-girl tale and flips it on its head by plunging both characters into the multiverse, where their love story is played out in all its variations. The script is “really, really funny,” the plot is “especially moving” and the characters are “impossible not to fall in love with,\" Produced by Exact Resemblance Theatre. Directed by Cristiana Ripeanu.

A return to writing “song songs” that might be played around a campfire. Mangan has experimented rigorously with his sound over the years, but resting in his roots may be where he operates most effortlessly. There is something fitting in Mangan hitting this high watermark at this stage of his life and career.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>You can trace the chapters of his story in the fabric of Natural Light. You’ll find remnants of the tenacious young artist who booked tours of Europe via Myspace in the mid-2000s.

The genre-bender who has subtly challenged his audience with each album, tracing a unique trajectory of confronting and eclipsing his own art.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Over two decades, Mangan has managed an enviably strong creative ethic, and his integrity as both a singer and songwriter has only strengthened with age. The big picture cohesiveness of Natural Light harkens to a pre-streaming, album-focused sensibility. Songs bleed together through focused transitions and overlapping interludes. Mangan’s lyrics act as gondolier for the journey, reassuring the listener that it’s cool to care.

Oscillating between spacious lo-fi 90s indie, and searing folk ballads, his newest project welcomes into the room the haunting accompaniment of the voice frozen and suspended in time. Designed to align with the timeline of his transition, he intentionally recorded his previous “high” voice and instrumentation in 2022, waited for his voice to drop after beginning testosterone, then asked frequent collaborator and longtime friend, Georgia Harmer to write vocal arrangements for his new “low” voice, helping him harmonize with his past self — an intentional, multilingual act of surrendering to change. While on previous projects, Larsen set his vocals in the backdrop of the music, on Blurring Time he unites and positions both voices at the forefront to deliver a bold, unyielding devotional.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_top\" href=\"https://bellslarsen.com/\">https://bellslarsen.com</a><span><br/></span><a target=\"_top\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bellslarsen/\">https://www.instagram.com/bellslarsen</a><span><br/></span><a target=\"_top\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bellslarsen/\">https://www.facebook.com/bellslarsen</a><span><br/></span><a target=\"_top\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bellslarsen\">https://www.tiktok.com/@bellslarsen</a><span><br/></span>

	$49 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For nearly two decades, Delhi 2 Dublin has been at the forefront of South Asian fusion music, pioneering a global bass sound they call “Subcontinental Pop”—a high-energy blend of Bhangra, electronic, hip-hop, reggae, and Celtic influences that defies genre and unites dance floors worldwide. As they approach their monumental 20th anniversary in 2026, the band is re-energized, re-inspired, and ready to launch a bold new chapter, creating fresh music for the first time in six years. Founding members Sanjay Seran and Ravi Binning continue to lead the charge, pushing Delhi 2 Dublin’s sound and vision to new heights.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>What began as a one-night collaboration at Vancouver’s Celtic Fest in 2006 quickly evolved into a global phenomenon, lighting up stages at Electric Forest (USA), Glastonbury (UK), Burning Man (USA), Bali Spirit Festival (Indonesia), and Woodford Folk Festival (Australia), among many others. Their music has taken them around the world, from the clubs of Mumbai to the deserts of Nevada, earning them a reputation for delivering “90 minutes of freebasing joy” at every show. For over a decade, violinist Serena Eades has been a driving force in the band, her electrifying performances and deep musicality adding a rich melodic layer to Delhi 2 Dublin’s ever-evolving sound.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Now, with fresh energy coursing through their veins, Delhi 2 Dublin welcomes producer, keyboardist, and tabla player Kal Mattu, who brings a renewed vibrancy to their ever-evolving sound. This infusion of talent, combined with their signature fusion of hypnotic dhol, deep bass, and euphoric hooks, ensures their next chapter will be as boundary-breaking and high-energy as ever.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>With a discography that includes critically acclaimed albums like Planet Electric (2010), Turn Up The Stereo (2012), and We’re All Desi (2015), Delhi 2 Dublin has consistently pushed the boundaries of South Asian music. Their 2019 album, We Got This, produced by Juno Award-winning Gavin Brown, marked a major milestone, earning commercial radio play for the song “My People.” Their innovative approach has secured top spots on international world music charts, millions of streams, multiple Western Canadian Music Awards, and recognition from major platforms like CBC Music, BBC Asian Network, and PBS.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>New music is on the horizon and the festival season promises to be bigger than ever, Delhi 2 Dublin is set to remind the world why they’ve remained at the top of the global bass music scene for two decades. The party isn’t slowing down - it’s just getting started.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Follow the journey: <a target=\"_top\" href=\"http://www.delhi2dublin.com\">www.delhi2dublin.com</a>

Welcome to the jubilant celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Tryzub Ukrainian Dance Society. Since its inception in 1974, Tryzub has stood as a beacon of artistic excellence, a symphony of spirited footwork and colorful costumes that tell the story of Ukraine’s rich heritage.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“DZVINKA,” Tryzub’s 50th Anniversary Show, is a unique 2-hour stage production that unveils over one hour of original music, composed and recorded amidst the shadows of war in Ukraine. Featuring new elaborate costumes crafted in Ukraine, the mesmerizing choreography takes audiences on a riveting journey encompassing excitement, anticipation, laughter, and moments of despair.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The first half of the show introduces an original storyline centered around Ukrainian folk hero Oleksa Dovbush—an outlaw, a hero to the people, and leader of the Opryshky. The second half navigates through the diverse regions of Ukraine, showcasing the delicate balance between intricate technique, colorful costumes, the grace and beauty of our female dancers, and the strength, determination, and gravity defying tricks of our male dancers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Despite formidable challenges, the costumes and music were created in Ukraine by brave individuals. As a result of the shutdown of Ukrainian airspace due to Russia’s war, the costumes were transported by van out of the country and then flown to Canada from neighboring nations. These costumes embody resilience amid adversity. As Russian military targets museums, theaters, and historical sites, orchestra musicians, scattered and forced to record in school classrooms, join hands with Tryzub in crafting original works like “DZVINKA.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Net Proceeds from the performance will be donated to support Ukrainian Newcomer programs that support the mental health and wellness of youth impacted by war.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

  schema:description """
	$49 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Kevin Kane first met Tom Hooper in 1977 (when they were aged 13 and 11) after Kevin and Tom’s older brother Chris bonded over a mutual love of The Beatles when the two had entered junior high school in Kelowna, BC. Kane started hanging out with the Hoopers in their basement for regular Friday night jam sessions, where they essentially learned to play their respective instruments together. By 1983 - influenced in equal parts by the British Invasion of the 60s and the DIY attitudes and immediacy of punk and new wave - the trio took the name The Grapes Of Wrath and began working on the songs that would make up their debut EP (1984) and first album (“September Bowl Of Green”) in 1985, released by the fledgling Vancouver indie Nettwerk Productions.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The band were soon signed by Capitol/EMI for the albums “Treehouse” (1987, with the breakout singles Peace Of Mind and Backward Town), “Now And Again” (1989, building on their successes with All The Things I Wasn’t and What Was Going Through My Head), and “These Days” (1991, featuring the hits I Am Here and You May Be Right). Thanks in no small part to the support of MuchMusic, The Grapes enjoyed gold and platinum sales and sold out shows at home in Canada, extensive radio play, and toured Europe twice in support of albums that also saw release in Japan, Australia, and South America. Then - with international success looming and for reasons no one is entirely clear on - the band disbanded in 1992.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Tom and Kevin resurrected the Grapes in the late 90s, releasing the album “Field Trip” (2000) on the Song Corp label, who folded immediately after it’s release. They came together again in the summer of 2009 for a series of acoustic duo shows around BC, celebrating their enduring friendship and the music they had created together. The following year, an offer from a festival for a full band reunion led to the return of drummer Chris, and the original three recorded “High Road” (2013 - named after the street the Hoopers lived on when they first started playing together as kids), their first album of new material in almost 22 years. They have been gigging regularly ever since and are arguably the longest-running and still-active “original lineup” in rock. Now - and as they had done briefly in 2009 - Tom and Kevin will once again hit the road as a duo to perform The Grapes’ music in an intimate and unplugged setting - telling the stories behind the songs and putting the focus on the harmonies and melodies of their timeless music.

  schema:description """
	$49.00 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Based in Victoria, BC, Jesse Roper is a blues/Americana artist with a penchant for writing modern indie-infused blues music and delivering bombastic live performances buoyed by his virtuosic guitar playing. His innate and impressive musical talent has served him well, giving him the flexibility to play with soul icon Booker T. Jones, rock veteran Colin James, blues belter Beth Hart, and Canadian legend Burton Cummings. The stage is where Roper shines. It has been his home since overcoming crippling stage fright during his early twenties. Fear is a part of Roper’s past that barely seems real today - especially when you see the in-concert image of a six-string soldier, hair matted to his face, tearing up the stage without a hint of second-guessing.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Roper’s last album ‘Horizons’ marked a sonic high point in his career thus far. Working closely with famed JUNO-nominated producer Gus van Go (Metric, The Stills, Whitehorse, Arkells, The Trews, Sam Roberts) on that new collection of songs has pushed Roper into creating some of his best work. “Recording with Gus was on a whole new level.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Roper latest releases are energetic, fresh, soulful and R&B-inspired tracks from a forthcoming LP that harkens the voices of JJ Cale, The Teskey Brothers, Leon Bridges, Ben Harper and others - while maintaining Roper's strong and unique expression in the genre. Jesse is a master at connecting his personal story and experiences to his songwriting - crafting narratives that hit on life's challenges and eccentricities - but that remain upbeat, engaging and wildly entertaining songs.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Adventuresome doesn’t properly describe Roper as an artist because when the guitar-wielding dynamo sets out to accomplish something, there’s no telling where his mind will wander or when his energy will go.

	<span class=\"BoldText\">$35.00 Per Person</span><span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Calling <span class=\"BoldText\">JJ Shiplett</span> a ‘force of nature’ might be considered hyperbole to those who haven’t heard the singer perform live, but for anyone that has, it fits the bill just right. Few musicians can capture a person’s attention by way of song as honestly and effortlessly the way JJ does. The Calgary, Alberta based musician, singer/songwriter and storyteller has an incredible ability to leave lasting impressions on anyone within earshot with his gruff, powerful yet dynamic voice.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Shiplett’s musical journey has seen him share the stage with many renowned acts in both Canada and internationally including Ben Harper, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Dwight Yoakam, The Sheepdogs, Serena Ryder, Michael Bernard Fitzgerald, Johnny Reid and many more. Using his vast vocal range, relatable lyrics and well thought out arrangements, the singer first made his mark on the Canadian music scene with 2017’s Something To Believe In, followed by 2020’s Fingers Crossed and Crossed Fingers. The albums showcased contemplative songwriting with emotive performances and have earned multiple Canadian Country Music<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Award nominations (CCMA’s) in the Americana/Roots and design categories. The spring of 2023, Shiplett began to release the first instalments of a new album called ‘A Way Through Time.’ Containing seven new songs recorded in picturesque Fort Langley BC at Fort Records with engineer and drummer Jay Stewart and multi-instrumentalist Jeremy Friesen - who was receiving treatment for stage 4 cancer at the time of the recording. The three were determined to make the most of the moment and enjoy the music making process knowing it would never happen again.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>‘I got a friend out west staring pretty hard into the future, cross your arms, hold on, we know that nothing ever stays the same…’<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Already There, the first release is a tingly ode to letting go with a classic pulse that propels JJ’s songwriting into territory previously staked by the likes of the Kathleen Edwards and Tyler Childers– we hear him opening up to the potential of not making any rules and challenging himself not to take his powerhouse voice and his choruses to the obvious places - chasing the desire of a great song over temporary acknowledgment.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The wistful Oleander, searching for balance in an unknown world where he recently became a father. Followed by the resigned ballad Modern Drugs and Bad Feelings (which peaked at #3 on CBC Music’s TOP 20) and the subtle and JJ Shiplett understated American Accent and Reckless Heart only serve to further pique one’s interest in the many places A Way Through Time and its successors will take Shiplett.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Boasting over 10 million global streams, he is not only a distinguished artist but also recognized as one of Canada's premier Americana-Roots musicians. And at this point in his career, the Western Canadian is content to take a backseat and let his songs lead the way.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For more information and the latest news on JJ Shiplett visit:<span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jjshiplett.com/\">www.jjshiplett.com</a>

Co-created and exquisitely performed by multi-award winning Tymisha Harris, accompanied by a live 4-piece jazz band, Harris delivers “the tale that is probably the closest to an evening with Josephine Baker as one will ever experience…What makes this telling so powerful is that Harris can act, sing and dance. Because she is a world-class triple threat, Harris brings Baker back to us. There are no supporting roles, and the demands on Harris are huge. Her talent and commitment are more than up to the job. She is riveting!” – Stage Biz Reviews, NYC.

One of today’s most thoughtful and prolific voices, he has released eleven studio albums including 2019’s widely acclaimed ‘Fever Breaks’ of which NPR Music praised, “He remains a hydrant of ideas while embodying an endless capacity for empathy and indignation, often within a single song.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>His twelfth studio album ‘I Believe in You, My Honeydew’ is out now. Two-plus decades into his celebrated career, Ritter has written music that has transcended generations including luminaries such as Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Bob Weir covering his songs.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Book of Gold Thrown Open tour is meant to encompass the whole of Ritter’s career, versus focusing on any one studio album.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>In addition to his work as a musician, Ritter is also a national best-selling author, having released two novels to date: 2021’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">The Great Glorious Goddamn of It All</span> and 2011’s <span class=\"ItalicText\">Bright’s Passage</span>. Released to critical attention, Stephen King wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Bright’s Passage “shines with a compressed lyricism that recalls Ray Bradbury in his prime…This is the work of a gifted novelist.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Josh Ritter remains at the top of his game two decades into a highlight-strewn career. He’d be forgiven for loosening his grip, but his hand has never felt surer.”<span><br/></span>- <span class=\"ItalicText\">NPR Music</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Harking back to Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and maybe a little Mark Knopfler, Mr. Ritter has always been a slinger of serious ideas and high-flown imagery.”<span><br/></span>- <span class=\"ItalicText\">The New York Times</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Mysterious, melancholy, melodic…and those are only the M’s.”<span><br/></span>- <span class=\"ItalicText\">Stephen King in Entertainment Weekly</span>

In addition to winning Taylor Solo Artist of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards, The Ridge was also nominated for: two JUNO Awards (Contemporary Folk Album of The Year, Indigenous Artist or Group of the Year), the Polaris Prize Long List, a Summer Solstice Indigenous Award (Contemporary Folk Album of the Year), a Canadian Music Week INDIES Award (Indigenous Artist of the Year), and an additional Canadian Folk Music Awards nomination in the English Songwriter of the Year category.

Recent highlights include a Juno Award nomination for his album ‘A Light in the Attic’, receiving the TD SOCAN Indigenous Songwriter Award, earning a Native American Music Award win in the U.S., and charting #7 iTunes Rock Chart for his single ‘Deadman’. Logan first rose to national prominence when he won CTV’s ‘The Launch’ and released his debut single ‘The Lucky Ones’ which peaked at #1 in Canada.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As a land defender, a cultural tastemaker, and a sought-after collaborator, he has performed and created with artists such as Allison Russel, Terra Lightfoot and Serena Ryder. He has brought his raw and electrifying performances across Canada, and around the world, with dates in the U.S., Europe and South America, and acted as support for Mumford & Sons, Eric Clapton and Steve Earle.

	<span class=\"BoldText\">​$42.00 Per Person</span><span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Royal Wood</span><span><br/></span>Royal Wood’s music continues to resonate worldwide, amassing over 30 million streams, numerous high-profile placements on shows like Grey’s Anatomy and Private Practice, and frequent playlist features across Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. Most recently, his single \"A Good Enough Day” was prominently featured in a TV campaign, propelling the track towards 4 million streams.<span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>His previous album, What Tomorrow Brings, received critical acclaim, and was considered for “Best Folk Album” at the 2024 Grammy Awards. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>His latest album DEAR JOHN was written, performed and produced by Royal himself and mixed by 5-time Grammy winning mixer Ryan Freeland. SPILL MAGAZINE said Dear John is “a brilliant album by a very important artist”. <span><br/></span> <span><br/></span>Known for translating his recorded work into captivating live performances, Royal Wood has headlined prestigious venues like Massey Hall in Toronto and Paradiso in Amsterdam, and toured extensively with several acclaimed artists including Bonnie Raitt and David Gray.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Fortunate Ones</span><span><br/></span>Out of a period of isolation, introspection, and honesty, emerges That Was You and Me, the new album from Fortunate Ones.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>With lush harmonies rising out of warm acoustic sounds, That Was You and Me finds Fortunate Ones reflecting on life, loss, grief, and hard times, and ultimately choosing love.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Every part of our lives was changing. It was a big transition period, personally and professionally,” says Catherine Allan, one half of the St. John’s, Newfoundland duo, of the period in which these songs were written. After touring their second album, Hold Fast, the two craved time to retreat, reconnect, and create. Some of that time was granted on the heels of surgery.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“I had a tumor removed from my hand in the summer of 2019,” explains Andrew James O’Brien, the duo’s other half. Recovery left him unable to play guitar in any serious way - and slow days at home had him rethinking what a career in music would or could be. Instead, a job at the picturesque Inn by Mallard Cottage found O’Brien up early day after day, working the front desk.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>That workaday life led to one of the album’s stand out songs. “Day to Day” was born in the very morning routine it describes. “One morning, the sun is not up,” O’Brien remembers. “Crawl downstairs half awake. I'm literally frying eggs and out of nowhere - this song comes. I don't have a guitar. I've never written a song like this before, full melody and verses in my head. Immediately words are coming, ‘alarm clock howls/I find my legs/crawl down the stairs/and fry my eggs.’ I'm writing this standing over the stove on my phone in complete silence. I'm thinking, holy shit, the whole song is done, end to end in my head. Never happened to me before in my life.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The song talks of finding meaning in the day to day - and finding meaning is an overarching theme on this album. O’Brien and Allan decided “that the only way to move forward was to infuse our work with as much meaning as possible,” Allan says, “so that whatever happened, we would feel full from it, and hopefully then people will feel that too.” O’Brien agrees. “My goal was to write unwaveringly meaningful work that was incredibly personal and didn’t hold back.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The result is an album stacked with songs about family, love, and finding one’s place. These songs are richly peopled and deeply personal - and at the same time, totally relatable. \"It was intentional,” O’Brien said. “It wasn't like, let's write songs because we need to fill a record. Each song is its own story and its own living thing.”<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Clarity” is an anxious heart’s search for answers. “You’re Still Here” details a long, hard year and offers hope for the future. And “It’s Worth It (for Leo)” is a beautiful tribute to O’Brien’s father, who is unwell. O’Brien was thinking about what he most wanted his father to know. “You've created a legacy of people that are honored and proud to come from you,” O’Brien says, “and that, looking back on your life, if you can think of one positive moment in a sea of experience, then it was worth being alive.” It’s a hard song to sing, O’Brien admits, and the album version is a single take that had O’Brien - and producer Joshua Van Tassel - in tears. “It is not edited at all. You can hear that I’m sniffly in the last verse. It was a really profound moment. We had to keep it.”

	$49 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Signed to Atlantic/Warner Records at the tender age of 19, four-time Juno nominee and modern-day Renaissance woman Sarah Slean has since released 11 albums in over 10 countries worldwide – but perhaps the most astonishing aspect of her artistry is its breadth. Over her 25-year career, Slean has published two volumes of poetry, starred in short films and a movie musical (spawning two Gemini Award nominations), penned two string quartets and other chamber works, held numerous exhibitions of her paintings, and shared the stage with 10 of the country’s professional orchestras. Classically trained from the age of 5, she routinely collaborates with cutting-edge contemporary classical ensembles like The Art of Time and has been invited to sing world premieres by Canada’s leading living composers. She composes orchestral arrangements for her own music as well as for her pop colleagues (Dan Mangan, Hawksley Workman) and her recent collaborative recording with the Symphony Nova Scotia was just nominated for both an East Coast Music Award and a Juno Award in the Classical Album category (2021). Sarah is also a recent alumna of the prestigious Canadian Film Centre's screen composing residency (2017-18) and just earned her first Canadian Screen Award (2021).<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Citing such diverse influences as Leonard Bernstein, philosophy, Joni Mitchell, Buddhism and Bach, her music borrows aspects of cabaret, pop, and orchestral: all knit together by the startling poetry of her lyrics, unique arranging and piano-playing, and that voice, described by the CBC as “a 19th century Kate Bush”. In addition to headlining theatres across Canada, Sarah has also toured Europe, the US and Scandinavia and has opened internationally for such artists as Bryan Ferry, Rufus Wainwright, Alanis Morissette, Andrew Bird, Feist, Ron Sexsmith, and Chris Isaak. Her 11th solo recording \"Metaphysics\", released in 2017, is described as a \"breathtaking amalgamation of Slean’s dramatic orchestral arranging and her signature take on songwriting\". In 2021-2022, Sarah will be composing the music for the stage musical adaptation of the award-winning film \"Maudie\".<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

This stand-out performance shone a bright light on this street poet from Vancouver’s Downtown East Side.<span><br/></span>Shane, an artist, inches away from living on the street and even in those troubled times, was putting out work like “<span class=\"BoldText\">To This Day</span>”, a video that’s garnered 24 million views and used worldwide in classrooms as a teaching tool, as well in speech and forensic competitions. His second book, “<span class=\"BoldText\">Stickboy</span>”, was adapted by Vancouver Opera. His voice has been sought after by luminaries like director George Miller, who worked with Shane on “<span class=\"BoldText\">Mad Max: Fury Road</span>”. Koyczan also created the piece, “<span class=\"BoldText\">Shoulders</span>”, which he toured with David Suzuki as part of The Blue Dot Tour, a movement to enshrine environmental rights in the constitution.<span><br/></span>A collaborator with artists such as Ani DiFranco, Dan Mangan, Tanya Tagaq, and others, Koyczan has elevated the Spoken Word art form, from its humble beginnings in after-hour cafes to stages both grand and distant. Shane brings an authenticity to his work that connects with audiences, as evidenced by his fiercely honest TED Talk, which highlights the kind of humanity he brings to each performance.<span><br/></span>Not just a poet moving from one subject to the next, Shane weaves his pieces together in a spellbinding narrative that show audiences themes that stretch over our lives. Koyczan continues moving through the difficult parts of our existence with humour in heart, and a notepad in hand; he scribbles down the whispers inside us and uses laughter as a poultice to press against our wounds.<span><br/></span>In 2017 Shane invited us deep into family trauma with the documentary “<span class=\"BoldText\">Shut Up And Say Something</span>”, an emotional trip through his past as he comes to terms with his estranged father. The film won Most Popular Documentary at Vancouver International Film Festival, moving audiences with its bravery and vulnerability.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>An artist whose work has transgressed genres and given breath to a new generation of voices, Shane Koyczan wears the mantle of human and dares others to discover what that means.

  schema:name "Sloan";
  schema:description """
	$59.00 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When attempting to provide an overview of a big story – one that encompasses both the myriad achievements of its subjects over a span of several decades and the impacts of those achievements – you can take two routes. There’s the “just the facts” approach, where you list off the people, places, and things that populate the tale, and then there’s another road that winds through the hows and whys behind the names and numbers. Looking at the story of Canadian indie rock institution Sloan, the temptation to look through both lenses is strong.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>For those who prefer the factual take, there are certainly enough noteworthy events and experiences peppered through the bands over 30-year history to make for a good yarn. There are the various musical incarnations that flowered in the rather fertile indie music scene in the Halifax, Nova Scotia of the late 1980s and early 1990s that brought bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy, guitarists/vocalists Jay Ferguson and Patrick Pentland, and drummer/vocalist Andrew Scott together – bands such as The Deluxe Boys, Happy Co., No Damn Fears and Kearney Lake Road that anyone of a certain vintage who hails from the Canadian coastal city will recall fondly.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>There’s the first recorded appearance in 1991 of what could be their earliest signature tune, “Underwhelmed,” that landed on a very hard-to-find compilation of Halifax acts called Hear and Now, which – combined with a chaotic but explosive self-promoted showcase during a Halifax music festival – brought them to the attention of various record labels, including the label du jour of the early 1990s, Geffen Records imprint DGC.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>That tidbit leads to the next chain of events – signing to DGC and releasing their first album, 1992’s Smeared, recorded in the same home studio of Halifax producer Terry Pulliam as the Hear and Now session at roughly the same time, but preceding that with their own indie release, the Peppermint EP, on their own label, murderecords. Propelled by support from a newly influential network of college radio stations and indie-friendly print publications, the band toured the U.S. and Canada before setting up shop in New York City to record their second full-length, Twice Removed, with producer Jim Rondinelli.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>And here we have the first big plot twist of the fact-based version of the Sloan story. Somewhat bored with the shoegazey, Abba-meets-My Bloody Valentine approach to their songwriting that was so well documented on Smeared, and immersing themselves in the bare-boned sonic templates of The Beatles’ “White Album” and Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours while traversing the continent in tour vans, the band turned in to DGC an album that was stripped of the manic, fizzy energy of the debut – replaced with a clarity and cleverness that augmented the catchiness of such songs as “Coax Me”, “Snowsuit Sound” and “People of the Sky”. But that approach flew in the face of what was “shifting units” at the time, and DGC was, to use a predictable pun, underwhelmed by an album that would go on to be named “the best Canadian album of all time” by Canada’s Chart Magazine.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>While this turn of events would kill most bands (and has in many cases), for Sloan it led to perhaps the most impressive array of facts and figures in the story to date. Discouraged by response to the new album by their label and staring down the prospect of finishing out a contract with a disinterested benefactor, the band contemplated winding down in 1995, playing a handful of rapturously received shows and recording one last hurrah in the Halifax studio of producer/engineer Laurence Currie for an album to released on murderecords. That album, 1996’s One Chord to Another, would prove to be a benchmark in the Sloan story, racking up hit singles in “The Good in Everyone,” “Everything You’ve Done Wrong” and “The Lines You Amend” and giving the band their first gold album, and their best-selling album to date.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>From there, the facts lead to the next big chapter in the story – the release of Navy Blues in 1998 and the band’s embrace of riff rock, leading to such arena-ready singles as “Money City Maniacs” and “She Says What She Means” resulting in another gold-plus album and tours of Japan, the UK and Australia. That success spurred the band on to greater artistic heights – the highly regarded Between the Bridges came quickly after, in 1999 – and a glance at the band’s discography further illustrates the scope of ambition within Sloan when it comes to their recorded output, with not one but two double albums in their studio recordings (2006’s Never Hear the End of It and 2014’s Commonwealth). Celebrating their 20th anniversary with 2011’s The Double Cross, the band began to explore its own legacy with sumptuous reissues of Twice Removed, One Chord to Another and Navy Blues, while also striving to add to that legacy with such strong, strident efforts as 2018’s 12 and 2022's Steady.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>So those are the facts. But between those bridges there’s a wealth of information and experience that takes this story somewhere else – beyond the realm of “successful Canadian rock band” to “venerable indie rock institution” status. And yes, that’s the second time we’ve used the word “institution,” but hear us out.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Sloan is that rare band that has an ethos that accompanies its discography. From those early gigs in the basement of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design to the present day, the band has eschewed the typical star-making machinery that puts one member as the driving creative force, with the rest of the band serving as trusted accomplices. Sloan boasts four singing, songwriting multi-instrumentalists, all of whom contribute to the final fabric woven into each album. As a result you have a depth and breadth of music that defies simple characterizations like “power pop” or even “indie rock” – 2001’s Pretty Together balances ornate chamber pop with fist-pumping rockers, while later efforts such as Never Hear the End of It and 12 contain multitudes in their track listings, ranging from Dylanesque streams of consciousness to short, sharp shocks of hardcore. But somehow, it all remains quintessentially Sloan.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>That comes down to another integral part of this ethos we’re banging on about. From day one, the lineup of the band has remained unchanged. Through thick and thin, geographical relocation from Halifax to Toronto and who knows how many challenges along the way, the band has stayed intact. Sure, many can point to the band’s practice, perhaps inspired by their hardcore and post-rock heroes, of splitting the earnings evenly. But there’s more at play here. There seems to be a shared understanding between both the band members themselves and their devoted audiences around the world that Sloan is the sum of its parts, and if one member were to leave for whatever reason, that would bring the story to a close. You can call this commitment – to an ideal, to friendships, to the music itself. But it resonates through the songs, through the live performances, and through the relationship the band has with their fans.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Ultimately, whichever route appeals most to you when looking at the big story that is Sloan, as you wind your way to the present day, there is one last thing worth considering – one bit of news that could be the starting point for the next attempt at approaching this story in the years ahead. In 2025, some 30-plus years on from when it all began, with the release of their 14th full-length album Based on the Best Seller, the tale is – thankfully – far from over.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“It's not a challenge to make a 14th album,” Jay Ferguson says, “But sometimes it's a challenge to think of a new overarching theme for a 14th album (and The Kinks’ 14th album was Soap Opera, essentially a TV play and complete story arc set to music, so clearly Ray Davies didn't have that problem). Our band has the capability to perform different styles within the rock/pop (or pop/rock) sphere, but it's often hard to harness the group to adhere to one particular style or theme. That's okay though. With four songwriters, we tend to make music that perhaps doesn't always naturally hang together under one (opened) umbrella but that's our style, and that style is continued on Based on the Best Seller. Nevertheless, whether it's Chris harmonizing on my songs, Patrick harmonizing on Chris' songs or Chris and our keyboardist Gregory vocally backing-up Andrew, I think those elements help tie together this (and previous) Sloan albums.”

  schema:description """
	$40.00 Per Person (<span class=\"BoldText\">No Minors 19+</span>)<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A modern indie folk trio from Newfoundland, The Once have collected a trio of Canadian Folk Music Awards, numerous ECMA awards, and was named Artist of the Year by the Newfoundland & Labrador Arts Council. They have earned not one, but two JUNO nominations for Roots Album of the Year and continue to take their music around the world.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The group formed in the tiny ex-fishing village of Trinity, Newfoundland and 'the once' means 'imminently, but not necessarily so' in local vernacular. “We wanted something that would embody who we are, where we’re from, and would elicit a smirk and a nod amongst Newfoundlanders back home but would forever require an explanation literally anywhere elsewhere” Andrew Dale offers. It is a story well worth explaining.

	$59.00 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>THE PIANO MEN- featuring the timeless classics of Billy Joel and Elton John<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>A musical journey through the 70’s... featuring the timeless classics of Billy Joel and Elton John<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The Piano Men is a musical celebration of the 1970’s- year by year, hit by hit- from the songbooks of Billy Joel and Elton John.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Award winning Canadian recording artist Jim Witter and his incredible band lead an expertly crafted tour of an entire decade that begins with “Your Song” and winds us along on a musical time machine, saluting two of the century’s most popular contemporary songwriters.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Utilizing spectacular visuals on a giant screen behind Witter and his band, we return to the newspaper headlines, the automobiles, the people, the events, the toys and even the TV shows that shaped a decade. Along the way, the sounds of “My Life”, “Candle in the Wind”, “Rocket Man”, “Just the Way You Are”, and many more classic hits create an evening that’s so much fun, you won’t want it to end. By the time you hit 1979, you’re begging these musicians to move back to 1970 and start all over again. With Witter at the grand piano and his incredibly talented band mates, the music is not an attempt to “recreate” or “mimic” the evening’s long list of familiar hits. Instead, Witter unleashes his golden tenor on hit after hit to recreate fully formed mental and emotional return visits to specific landmarks in a pop culture timeline.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>If you can remember where you were when Elvis may have died, this shows for you. If you can smell the interior of your 1973 VW Beetle, you’ll recognize every song. If you watch re-runs of Gilligan’s Island or Green Acres, you’ll find yourself singing along. And if you still have your bell-bottom jeans and Puma running shoes, then you probably need more help than Witter can provide...<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Now in its 16th year of touring, “The Piano Men” has enjoyed sold-out performances, return engagements and rave reviews in theatres across North America, Great Britain and Dubai. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip down memory lane!

  schema:description """
	$45.00 Per Person<span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This is not your average cover band, but a creative tribute and a re-imagining of Leonard Cohen's songs and poetry by 2 of BC's celebrated singer-songwriters: 2x Western Canada Music Award Winner and Juno Nominee Oliver Swain, and Glenna Garramone. Together they have arranged Cohen's timeless songs beautifully, for two voices, string bass, piano, guitar, and banjo.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"I said to Hank Williams, how lonely does it get?<span><br/></span>Hank Williams hasn't answered yet<span><br/></span>But I hear him coughing all night long<span><br/></span>A hundred floors above me, in the Tower of Song\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When Leonard Cohen sang these words, the Tower of Song was a metaphor for the inspiration that flows between songwriters, each toiling away on their own, but connected by their shared craft. Moved by this concept, Oliver Swain and Glenna Garramone collaborated to produce a project that is a dialogue through song and a tribute to the legendary songwriter. Re-imagining both rare and classic works of Cohen, the duo have crafted a sound that resonates with both longtime Cohen fans and a younger audience. This is the work of Cohen as you’ve never heard it before.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>As Canada's longest running Leonard Cohen tribute, Tower of Song have toured across Canada several times, playing more than 200 shows to thousands of people in theatres and folk clubs across Canada. Highlights include a mainstage performance at the Salmon Arm Roots & Blues Festival and sold out shows at Rotary Centre for the Arts in Kelowna, the Dave Dunnet Theatre in Victoria, the West End Cultural Centre in Winnipeg, and Aeolian Hall in London. Encouraged by the audience response, Tower of Song recorded their debut album In City and In Forest, with Juno award winning producer Joby Baker. Visit www.towerofsongmusic.com for more info.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>\"The tunes are hauntingly lovely. Wonderful takes with close harmonies and re-rhythmings. Musically sound. Faithful by being strongly, creatively Cohen, and yet wholly their own.\"<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>- James N. Porter, Professor Emeritus (Arts), York University<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Oliver Swain<span><br/></span>2x Western Canada Music Award winning and Juno nominated Americana Folk Noir musician Oliver Swain spent a dozen years in some of North America's most loved roots bands (Outlaw Social, The Duhks, The Bills) before going solo and releasing In a BIG MACHINE in to rave reviews, #1 spots on the charts, sold out shows and festival appearances across western Canada. A naturalist musician who was drawn to Louisiana and Appalachia several times to discover the roots of American music for himself, Oliver resides in Victoria, BC where frequent journeys into the rugged BC wilderness fuel his songwriting, singing and playing styles. Performing on Banjo and String Bass, led by tremendous vocal abilities, Oliver's live show has attracted a lot of attention over the years including that of Tamara Kater, Executive Director of Folk Music Canada: \"Since I first discovered him in 2008, Oliver Swain has been one of my very favorite artists... an evening spent with Oliver Swain will leave you breathless and joyful.\" Visit Oliver Swain for more info.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Glenna Garramone<span><br/></span>Based in Victoria, BC, Canada, Glenna Garramone is equally at home as a solo artist and in collaboration with a wide range of performers. Career highlights include mainstage performances at Telluride Bluegrass Festival, the Vancouver Folk Festival, and Rifflandia, as a keyboard player and vocalist for the band Shane Koyczan and the Short Story Long, with whom she co-wrote for their most recent album, Debris (featuring guest Ani DiFranco). With a style somewhere between Keith Jarrett and Joni Mitchell, Glenna Garramone's songwriting earned her Grand prize in the Artswells Songwriting Contest, and the award-winning song \"Bear Scat\" was featured on CBC Radio's North By Northwest with Sheryl MacKay. Inspired by the geography, inhabitants, and spirit of the places she has lived, from Nunavut to Hawaii, Glenna Garramone crafts \"raw, emotional, and utterly captivating\" songs (John Threlfall, Monday Magazine), using anything from piano, to guitar, to her tap shoes. She also holds a BFA in Writing from the University of Victoria, with a major in Poetry. Glenna is founder and director of The Pandora Chorus, an indie-pop-rock choir. Visit Glenna Garramone for more info.

A man with a thousand friends, from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island to Texas to New Zealand, he’s a singer, guitarist and songwriter who catches the small but telling moments that make up life.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Remembered for Play Me a Rock and Roll Song, his bitter-sweet memory of finding himself, a relaxed and amiable story-teller, facing a rambunctious audience at the Aldergrove Rock Festival circa 1968, Valdy has sold almost half a million copies of his 13 albums, has two Juno Awards (Folk Singer of the Year and Folk Entertainer of the Year), a total of seven Juno nominations and four Gold albums to his credit.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Valdy’s recent CDs include “Contenders”, a collaboration with friend and fellow singer/songwriter, Gary Fjellgaard, with whom he has an absolute blast touring, and a solo release, “Viva Valdy: Live at Last”, a two-CD package, one live, one studio, with a total of 25 tunes, and a lyric booklet.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>One of Canada’s most influential songwriters, Valdy’s composition A Good Song was recorded under the title Just a Man by the venerable Quincy Jones (he sang lead on the recording!). Play Me a Rock and Roll Song has been recorded by a few artists, including John Kay of Steppenwolf.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Along the way, Valdy has taken his music to a dozen different countries, from Denmark to Australia and been an often-invited performer at the prestigious Kerrville Festival in Texas. His past television appearances include Canada AM and Open Mike with Mike Bullard. Valdy has also been a panelist on Front Page Challenge and played a lead role in an episode of The Beachcombers original series.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>SHOW REVIEWS…<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">“…judging by last night’s performance, Valdy’s musical magic is alive and well.” </span><span><br/></span>-Beacon Herald<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">“One of the best evenings of entertainment Confederation Centre has ever seen…. a man of formidable talents.”</span><span><br/></span>Charlottetown Evening Patriot<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">“Valdy remains one of the country’s purest and most credible storytellers.”</span><span><br/></span>-Toronto Star<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">“He’s a master of country, folk, rock and blues, and the catch is that whatever the sound, people know that Valdy is sincere.”</span><span><br/></span>-Saskatoon Star Phoenix<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">“Valdy’s show is a disarming and practical blend of respect for the audience and show business expertise.”</span><span><br/></span>Edmonton Journal

	<span class=\"BoldText\">$39.00 Per Person</span><span><br/></span>Including fees & charges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Singer/songwriter Vanessa Collier’s sixth album Do It My Own Way was released September 13 via Phenix Fire Records. Recorded on analog gear with the musicians largely in one room, Do It My Own Way is sonically inspired by the classic Memphis soul sound of Stax and Hi Records, especially that of the Staples Singers. Second single “Wild As a Rainstorm,” which dives deep into soul territory, powerfully gives advice to women and people who feel left out to ignore the naysayers and “Be a tapestry of dreams.” The track has been added to Spotify’s official Retro Soul playlist. The groove and horns would make Willie Mitchell proud and indeed features legendary Hi Records organist Rev. Charles Hodges. The vocals are powerful, awe-inspiring, and undeniably soulful vocals.

Following an incredible sell out tour, Walk Right Back returns to stages in 2026. From the producers of UK’s smash hit show That’ll Be The Day, this phenomenal production tells the story of the most successful musical duo of all time – The Everly Brothers. Featuring hits such as Bye Bye Love, All I Have To Do Is Dream and Cathy’s Clown, this unique concert-based musical entwines the wonderful, sad yet glorious story of The Everly Brothers.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The show follows the brothers’ rise to fame from humble country beginning to superstardom, through their decade-long feud to their glorious reunion which gave them back to each other, and back to the world. With “harmonies from heaven” that influenced The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and Simon & Garfunkel, The Everly Brothers were unmatched in their talent. Also featuring songs from a couple of the Everly Brothers' good friends, Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Producer Trevor Payne (That’ll Be The Day) says: « The Everly Brothers were an original and unique act that had a sound like nothing else. Their harmonies were so tight that every group wanted to emulate them. Before that there was a singer, a band and backing vocals, The Everly’s entwined all of them and created ‘the harmony group’».<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Walk Right Back is the first show of its kind to tell this phenomenal story of two brothers and their unforgettable music.
